‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md    # Main educational content
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ quiz.md     # Interactive assessment questions
```

**Naming Conventions**:
- Chapters: `Chapter-{01-26}-{Descriptive-Name}` (zero-padded numbers)
- Sections: `Section-{01-99}-{Descriptive-Name}` (zero-padded numbers)
- Use kebab-case for descriptive names (e.g., `Chapter-05-OOP-foundations`)
- Always include both `index.md` and `quiz.md` for each section

### Content Standards

**Writing Style**:
- Use clear, concise language appropriate for Year 11-12 students
- Write in third person neutral voice
- Use Australian English spelling and terminology
- Keep paragraphs short (1-3 sentences) for readability
- Include practical examples that students can relate to

**Educational Structure**:
Each section should follow this template:
- **H1**: Section title (numbered, e.g., "1.1 Software development steps")
- **H2**: Why it matters (relevance and context)
- **H2**: Concepts (core learning content)
  - **H3**: Individual concept explanations
  - **H3**: Guided examples and demonstrations
- **H2**: Try it / Practice (hands-on activities)
- **H2**: Recap (summary and key takeaways)

**Code Examples**:
- Use Python as the primary programming language
- Provide working, tested code that students can run
- Include comments explaining key concepts
- Progress from simple REPL examples to complete scripts
- Avoid external dependencies unless essential to the learning objective

### Assessment Guidelines

**Quiz Format**:
Use the custom quiz admonition format:
```markdown
!!! quiz "Section X.Y Quiz: Topic Name"

    1. Question text here?
        - Option A
        - Option B {data-correct}
        - Option C
        - Option D
```

**Quiz Standards**:
- Include 6-10 questions per section
- Mix multiple choice and multiple select questions
- Mark correct answers with `{data-correct}` in option text
- Focus on understanding and application, not memorization
- Include questions that connect to other parts of the curriculum

### Visual Elements

**Diagrams**:
- Use PlantUML for system diagrams, class diagrams, and process flows
- Keep diagrams simple and focused on educational concepts
- Include source code in fenced blocks before generated diagrams
- Escape double underscores in method names (`\_\_init\_\_`)

**Images and Media**:
- Include descriptive alt text for accessibility
- Use high-contrast colors for readability
- Ensure images work well in both light and dark themes
- Keep file sizes reasonable for fast loading

## üîß Technical Guidelines
