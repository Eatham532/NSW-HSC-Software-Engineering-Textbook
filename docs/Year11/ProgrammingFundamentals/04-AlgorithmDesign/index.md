# Module 4: Algorithm Design

## Introduction

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems. They're the logical foundation of all software - the "recipes" that tell computers exactly what to do.

## Why Algorithm Design Matters

Before writing a single line of code, programmers must think through:
- **What problem** am I solving?
- **What steps** are needed to solve it?
- **What order** should these steps be in?
- **What decisions** need to be made along the way?
- **When should** the process repeat or stop?

This systematic thinking process is called **computational thinking**.

## Computational Thinking Process

### 1. Decomposition
Break large problems into smaller, manageable parts.

### 2. Pattern Recognition  
Identify similarities and recurring elements.

### 3. Abstraction
Focus on essential details, ignore irrelevant complexity.

### 4. Algorithm Design
Create step-by-step solutions using logical structures.

## Module Contents

### [Computational Thinking](computational-thinking.md)
Master the problem-solving approach used by professional programmers.

### [Pseudocode & Flowcharts](pseudocode-flowcharts.md)
Learn to design algorithms using industry-standard notation and diagrams.

### [Algorithm Analysis](algorithm-analysis.md)
Understand how to evaluate and improve algorithm efficiency.

### [Structured Algorithms](structured-algorithms.md)
Explore advanced techniques like recursion, divide-and-conquer, and backtracking.

## Real-World Application: StudyBuddy Features

Let's see how algorithms power our StudyBuddy app:

### Assignment Priority Algorithm
```
1. Get all incomplete assignments
2. For each assignment:
   a. Calculate days until due date
   b. Determine assignment difficulty
   c. Factor in point value
3. Sort by priority score (highest first)
4. Display top 5 to user
```

### Study Reminder Algorithm
```
1. Check current time
2. Look up user's preferred study schedule
3. If it's a scheduled study time:
   a. Check for pending assignments
   b. If assignments exist, send notification
   c. Log reminder in user history
4. Wait 30 minutes, repeat
```

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Apply computational thinking to break down complex problems
- Design algorithms using pseudocode and flowcharts
- Analyze algorithm efficiency and identify improvements
- Implement common algorithmic patterns and techniques
- Translate real-world problems into algorithmic solutions

## Algorithm Design Principles

### Start Simple
Begin with basic logic, then add complexity gradually.

### Think Before Coding
Spend time planning the algorithm before writing code.

### Test with Examples
Walk through your algorithm with sample data.

### Consider Edge Cases
What happens with empty data, maximum values, or unexpected input?

### Optimize Later
Get it working correctly first, then improve performance.
