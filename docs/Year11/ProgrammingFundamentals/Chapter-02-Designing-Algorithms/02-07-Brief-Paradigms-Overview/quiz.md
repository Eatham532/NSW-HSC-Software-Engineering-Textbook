!!! quiz "Check your understanding"

    1. What is a programming paradigm?

        - A specific programming language
        - A fundamental style or approach to programming { data-correct }
        - A type of computer hardware
        - A debugging technique

    2. Which paradigm focuses on step-by-step instructions and changing variables?

        - Object-oriented
        - Functional
        - Imperative { data-correct }
        - Logic

    3. What is the core idea of object-oriented programming?

        - Write mathematical functions
        - Model the world as interacting objects { data-correct }
        - Create step-by-step instructions
        - Express facts and rules

    4. Which paradigm would be best suited for creating an expert system that diagnoses medical conditions based on symptoms?

        - Imperative
        - Object-oriented
        - Logic { data-correct }
        - Functional

    5. What distinguishes functional programming from other paradigms?

        - Uses objects with methods
        - Focuses on mathematical functions and immutable data { data-correct }
        - Requires step-by-step instructions
        - Only works with logical rules

    6. Which statement about programming paradigms is most accurate?

        - Only one paradigm should be used per program
        - Imperative programming is always the best choice
        - Different paradigms are suited to different types of problems { data-correct }
        - All paradigms produce identical results

    7. If you were building a video game with players, enemies, and items, which paradigm would be most natural?

        - Logic programming
        - Functional programming
        - Object-oriented programming { data-correct }
        - Pure mathematical functions

    8. What does "immutability" mean in functional programming?

        - Functions cannot be combined
        - Variables cannot change once set { data-correct }
        - Objects cannot have methods
        - Programs cannot have loops
