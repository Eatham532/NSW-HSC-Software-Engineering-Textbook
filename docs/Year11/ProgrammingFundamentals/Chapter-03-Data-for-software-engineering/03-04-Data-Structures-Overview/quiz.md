# 03.04 Data Structures Overview - Quiz

!!! quiz "Check your understanding"

    1. What is a data structure?

        - A way of writing Python code more efficiently
        - A method for organizing and storing data so it can be accessed and modified efficiently { data-correct }
        - A type of algorithm for sorting data
        - A programming language feature for creating variables

    2. In Python, which data structure is used to represent single-dimensional arrays?

        - Tuples
        - Sets
        - Lists { data-correct }
        - Dictionaries

    3. How do you access the first element in a Python list called `grades`?

        - `grades[1]`
        - `grades[0]` { data-correct }
        - `grades.first()`
        - `grades[-1]`

    4. What would be the result of `grades[1][2]` if `grades = [[85, 92, 78], [91, 87, 94]]`?

        - 85
        - 92
        - 94 { data-correct }
        - 87

    5. Which data structure is best for grouping related information like a student's name, age, and grade?

        - List
        - Dictionary (Record) { data-correct }
        - Stack
        - CSV file

    6. In a stack data structure, which principle does it follow?

        - First In, First Out (FIFO)
        - Last In, First Out (LIFO) { data-correct }
        - Random Access
        - Alphabetical Order

    7. Which Python operation is used to add an element to the top of a stack (implemented as a list)?

        - `insert()`
        - `add()`
        - `append()` { data-correct }
        - `push()`

    8. What is the main advantage of using a hash table (Python dictionary) for a phone book?

        - It automatically sorts names alphabetically
        - It provides instant lookup by name { data-correct }
        - It uses less memory than other data structures
        - It can store more phone numbers

    9. Which data structure would be most appropriate for representing a family tree?

        - List
        - Stack
        - Tree { data-correct }
        - CSV file

    10. In CSV files, what does CSV stand for?

        - Computer Separated Values
        - Comma Separated Values { data-correct }
        - Character Separated Variables
        - Column Separated Variables

    11. If you need to implement an "undo" function in a text editor, which data structure would be most appropriate?

        - List with random access
        - Dictionary
        - Stack { data-correct }
        - Tree

    12. Which of the following is the best use case for a 2D list (multidimensional array)?

        - Storing a single student's grades
        - Representing a game board or seating chart { data-correct }
        - Implementing a phone book lookup
        - Creating an undo function
