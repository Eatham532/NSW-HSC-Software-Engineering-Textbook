# Module 3: Data Types & Structures

## Introduction

Data is the foundation of every software application. Understanding how computers represent, store, and manipulate different types of information is crucial for effective programming.

    type: example

**Every app you use processes data:**
- ðŸ“± Instagram stores millions of photos and user profiles
- ðŸŽµ Spotify manages vast music libraries and user preferences
- ðŸŽ® Fortnite tracks player statistics and game states
- ðŸ’¬ Discord handles real-time messages and user data

The way this data is organized directly impacts performance, storage efficiency, and user experience.

## Understanding Data Representation

Computers don't naturally understand human concepts like names, images, or music. Everything must be converted into patterns of 0s and 1s (binary). This module teaches you:

- How different number systems work and why they matter
- What data types are available and when to use each
- How to organize data efficiently using structures
- Best practices for documenting and managing data

## Module Contents

### [Number Systems](number-systems.md)
Explore binary, decimal, and hexadecimal systems - the foundation of all computer data.

### [Data Types](data-types.md)
Learn about integers, strings, booleans, and other fundamental data types.

### [Data Structures](data-structures.md)
Discover arrays, records, trees, and other ways to organize related information.

### [Data Dictionaries](data-dictionaries.md)
Master the art of documenting data structure and relationships.

## Real-World Applications

### StudyBuddy Data Requirements
Our example app needs to handle:
- **User Information**: Names, emails, student IDs
- **Assignments**: Titles, due dates, subjects, priorities
- **Progress Tracking**: Completion status, time spent
- **Settings**: Notification preferences, themes

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand different number systems and their applications
- Choose appropriate data types for various scenarios
- Design efficient data structures for real-world problems
- Create comprehensive data dictionaries
- Analyze data requirements for software projects
