# 04.05 Debugging Tools And Techniques - Quiz

!!! quiz "Check your understanding"

    1. What is debugging?

        - Removing comments from code
        - Optimizing code for better performance
        - Finding and fixing errors in code { data-correct }
        - Compiling code to machine language

    2. Which type of bug prevents code from running at all?

        - Logic errors
        - Runtime errors
        - Syntax errors { data-correct }
        - Performance errors

    3. What happens when a runtime error occurs?

        - The code won't compile
        - The code runs but crashes during execution { data-correct }
        - The code produces incorrect results
        - The code runs slowly

    4. In the factorial debugging activity, what was wrong with `range(n)`?

        - It included zero in the multiplication { data-correct }
        - It was too slow
        - It used too much memory
        - It caused a syntax error

    5. What is the simplest debugging technique?

        - Using breakpoints
        - Adding print statements { data-correct }
        - Single line stepping
        - Using watches

    6. What is a breakpoint?

        - A syntax error in code
        - A marker that pauses program execution { data-correct }
        - A type of loop
        - A function parameter

    7. When debugging the factorial function, what should factorial(0) return?

        - 0
        - 1 { data-correct }
        - undefined
        - an error

    8. What debugging technique lets you monitor specific variables during execution?

        - Breakpoints
        - Watches { data-correct }
        - Print statements
        - Single stepping

    9. Which statement is used to check preconditions and postconditions in Python?

        - print()
        - if
        - assert { data-correct }
        - try

    10. What is "single line stepping"?

        - Writing code one line at a time
        - Executing code one line at a time { data-correct }
        - Deleting code one line at a time
        - Commenting code one line at a time

    11. In the buggy factorial function, why did factorial(1) return 0?

        - The function was called incorrectly
        - range(1) produces [0], so 1 Ã— 0 = 0 { data-correct }
        - There was a division by zero
        - The variable wasn't initialized

    12. What should you do FIRST when debugging?

        - Fix the code immediately
        - Ask someone else for help
        - Reproduce the bug consistently { data-correct }
        - Rewrite the entire function
