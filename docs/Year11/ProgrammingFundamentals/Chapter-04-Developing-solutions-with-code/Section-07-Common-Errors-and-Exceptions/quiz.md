    - IndexError { data-correct }
    - KeyError
    - ValueError
    - TypeError

!!! quiz "Question 3"
    What causes a ZeroDivisionError?

    - Dividing a number by zero { data-correct }

    - Adding zero to a number
    - Subtracting zero from a number

!!! quiz "Question 4"
    In the condition `if age >= 13 or age <= 65:`, what's the logic error?

    - Should use 'and' instead of 'or' { data-correct }
    - Should use > instead of >=
    - Should use < instead of <=
    - Nothing is wrong with this condition

!!! quiz "Question 5"

    - Not using a break statement
    - Having too many iterations

!!! quiz "Question 8"
    Which is the best way to handle division by zero?

    - Ignore it and hope it doesn't happen
    - Check if denominator is zero before dividing { data-correct }
    - Use only whole numbers
    - Avoid division operations

!!! quiz "Question 9"
