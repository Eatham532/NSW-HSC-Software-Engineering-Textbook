# 04.01 Control Structures In Python - Quiz

!!! quiz "Check your understanding"

    1. What are the three fundamental control structures in programming?

        - Input, Processing, Output
        - Variables, Functions, Classes
        - Sequence, Selection, Iteration { data-correct }
        - If, While, For

    2. In Python, which statement is used to make decisions based on conditions?

        - `for`
        - `while`
        - `if` { data-correct }
        - `def`

    3. What will this code print?

        ```python
        for i in range(3):
            print(i)
        ```

        - 1, 2, 3
        - 0, 1, 2 { data-correct }
        - 3, 2, 1
        - 1, 2, 3, 4

    4. Which Python keyword is used to create an alternative condition in an if statement?

        - `else if`
        - `elif` { data-correct }
        - `elseif`
        - `otherwise`

    5. What type of loop should you use when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat something?

        - `while` loop
        - `for` loop { data-correct }
        - `do-while` loop
        - `repeat` loop

    6. What will happen with this code?

        ```python
        count = 1
        while count <= 3:
            print(count)
        ```

        - Prints 1, 2, 3 and stops
        - Prints nothing
        - Creates an infinite loop { data-correct }
        - Causes a syntax error

    7. In the range function `range(2, 8, 2)`, what numbers will be generated?

        - 2, 4, 6 { data-correct }
        - 2, 4, 6, 8
        - 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
        - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

    8. Which logical operator would you use to check if BOTH conditions are true?

        - `or`
        - `and` { data-correct }
        - `not`
        - `xor`

    9. What is the correct way to structure a nested if statement in Python?

        - Use curly braces {} to group code blocks
        - Use proper indentation to show which code belongs to each if { data-correct }
        - Use semicolons to separate conditions
        - Use parentheses around the entire block

    10. In a while loop, when does the loop stop executing?

        - When the condition becomes true
        - When the condition becomes false { data-correct }
        - After exactly 10 iterations
        - When a break statement is encountered

    11. Which control structure is being used in this pseudocode?

        ```
        IF score >= 90 THEN
            grade = "A"
        ELIF score >= 80 THEN
            grade = "B"
        ELSE
            grade = "C"
        ```

        - Sequence
        - Selection { data-correct }
        - Iteration
        - Function

    12. What is a common mistake that causes "off-by-one" errors in for loops?

        - Using the wrong variable name
        - Incorrect range boundaries { data-correct }
        - Missing indentation
        - Using while instead of for
