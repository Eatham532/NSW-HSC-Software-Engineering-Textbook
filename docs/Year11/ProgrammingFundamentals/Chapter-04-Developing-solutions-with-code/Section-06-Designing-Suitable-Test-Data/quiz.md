# Quiz: Designing Suitable Test Data

!!! quiz "Question 1"
    What is test data?

    - Data stored in a database
    - Input used to check if a program works correctly { data-correct }
    - Output produced by a program
    - Code comments that explain the program

!!! quiz "Question 2"
    Which type of test data represents the most common inputs?

    - Boundary data
    - Normal data { data-correct }
    - Invalid data
    - Extreme data

!!! quiz "Question 3"
    What is boundary data used for?

    - Testing typical user inputs
    - Testing the limits of what a program should handle { data-correct }
    - Testing very large values only
    - Testing error conditions

!!! quiz "Question 4"
    For a function that grades scores 0-100, which is a boundary test case?

    - Testing with score 85
    - Testing with score 100 { data-correct }
    - Testing with score 50
    - Testing with score 75

!!! quiz "Question 5"
    What should invalid data testing check?

    - How the program handles bad input { data-correct }
    - The fastest execution speed
    - The most common use cases
    - Perfect input conditions

!!! quiz "Question 6"
    In equivalence partitioning, why do we group similar inputs?

    - To reduce the number of tests needed { data-correct }
    - To make testing more complex
    - To test only one input type
    - To avoid testing edge cases

!!! quiz "Question 7"
    What is decision table testing used for?

    - Testing all combinations of conditions { data-correct }
    - Testing only normal data
    - Testing database connections
    - Testing user interfaces

!!! quiz "Question 8"
    For age categories (Child: 0-12, Teen: 13-19, Adult: 20+), what are the key boundary values to test?

    - 0, 12, 13, 19, 20 { data-correct }
    - 5, 15, 25
    - 1, 10, 18
    - 6, 16, 30

!!! quiz "Question 9"
    What happens when you only test with "normal" data?

    - You find all possible bugs
    - You might miss edge cases and error conditions { data-correct }
    - Your program will be perfectly reliable
    - Testing becomes more efficient

!!! quiz "Question 10"
    Which is an example of extreme data for a discount calculation function?

    - 10% discount on $100
    - 150% discount on $100 { data-correct }
    - 5% discount on $50
    - 20% discount on $75

!!! quiz "Question 11"
    Why should test cases be documented?

    - To make them repeatable and understandable { data-correct }
    - To slow down the testing process
    - To hide testing strategies
    - To make testing more complex

!!! quiz "Question 12"
    When should you design test data?

    - After the program is completely finished
    - Before writing the code { data-correct }
    - Only when bugs are found
    - During program deployment
