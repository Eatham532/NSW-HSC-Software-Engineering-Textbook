# Development 💻

## Writing the Actual Code

Development is where designs and specifications become working software. This phase involves writing code, implementing features, and building the foundation of your application.

## StudyBuddy Core Implementation

### Application Structure

**StudyBuddy Core Classes:**

```python
class StudyBuddy:
    def __init__(self, user_id):
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.subjects = []
        self.assignments = []
        self.notifications = NotificationManager()
    
    def add_assignment(self, title, subject, due_date, priority="medium"):
        """Add a new assignment to track"""
        assignment = Assignment(title, subject, due_date, priority)
        self.assignments.append(assignment)
        self.schedule_reminder(assignment)
        return f"✅ Added {title} for {subject}"
    
    def get_todays_tasks(self):
        """Get assignments due today or overdue"""
        today = datetime.now().date()
        todays_tasks = []
        for assignment in self.assignments:
            if assignment.due_date <= today and not assignment.completed:
                todays_tasks.append(assignment)
        return todays_tasks
    
    def track_study_time(self, subject, minutes):
        """Record time spent studying"""
        study_session = StudySession(subject, minutes, datetime.now())
        self.log_progress(study_session)

class Assignment:
    def __init__(self, title, subject, due_date, priority="medium"):
        self.id = generate_unique_id()
        self.title = title
        self.subject = subject
        self.due_date = due_date
        self.priority = priority
        self.completed = False
        self.created_at = datetime.now()
    
    def mark_complete(self):
        self.completed = True
        self.completed_at = datetime.now()

class Subject:
    def __init__(self, name, color="#3498db"):
        self.id = generate_unique_id()
        self.name = name
        self.color = color
        self.assignments = []
        self.total_study_time = 0
```

    type: example

**Discord was built in just 2 months!** The founders focused on core features first: text chat, voice chat, and servers. They didn't try to build everything at once - they started with the minimum viable product and iterated quickly.

## Development Best Practices

### 1. Start Small, Build Incrementally
Don't try to build everything at once. Start with core features and add complexity gradually.

**StudyBuddy Development Phases:**
- **Phase 1:** Basic assignment creation and listing
- **Phase 2:** Due date reminders and notifications  
- **Phase 3:** Subject organization and progress tracking
- **Phase 4:** Cloud sync and collaboration features

### 2. Write Clean, Readable Code

#### Use Meaningful Names
```python
# ❌ Bad - unclear names
def calc(a, b):
    return a + b

# ✅ Good - clear and descriptive
def calculate_total_study_hours(completed_hours, planned_hours):
    return completed_hours + planned_hours
```

#### Keep Functions Small and Focused
```python
# ❌ Bad - function does too many things
def handle_assignment():
    # Validate input
    # Save to database  
    # Send notifications
    # Update UI
    # Log analytics
    pass

# ✅ Good - separate concerns
def validate_assignment_data(data):
    # Only validation logic
    pass

def save_assignment(assignment):
    # Only database operations
    pass

def send_assignment_notification(assignment):
    # Only notification logic
    pass
```

### 3. Handle Errors Gracefully

```python
def add_assignment(self, title, subject, due_date):
    try:
        # Validate inputs
        if not title or not subject:
            raise ValueError("Title and subject are required")
        
        if due_date < datetime.now().date():
            raise ValueError("Due date cannot be in the past")
        
        # Create and save assignment
        assignment = Assignment(title, subject, due_date)
        self.assignments.append(assignment)
        
        return {"success": True, "assignment": assignment}
        
    except ValueError as e:
        return {"success": False, "error": str(e)}
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Unexpected error adding assignment: {e}")
        return {"success": False, "error": "Something went wrong"}
```

### 4. Use Version Control

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/add-assignments

# Make changes, then commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add assignment creation functionality

- Implement Assignment class with validation
- Add methods to StudyBuddy for managing assignments  
- Include error handling for invalid inputs"

# Push to remote repository
git push origin feature/add-assignments
```

## Development Patterns

### 1. Model-View-Controller (MVC)
Separate data (Model), presentation (View), and logic (Controller).

### 2. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
If you write the same code twice, create a function.

### 3. Single Responsibility Principle
Each class and function should have one clear purpose.

### 4. Test as You Go
Write tests for your functions to catch bugs early.

```python
def test_add_assignment():
    """Test that assignments are added correctly"""
    app = StudyBuddy("test_user")
    result = app.add_assignment("Math Quiz", "Algebra", "2025-08-10")
    
    assert result["success"] == True
    assert len(app.assignments) == 1
    assert app.assignments[0].title == "Math Quiz"
```

## Common Development Challenges

### 1. Scope Creep
**Problem:** Adding features that weren't in the original plan
**Solution:** Stick to your requirements and specifications

### 2. Technical Debt
**Problem:** Quick fixes that make code harder to maintain
**Solution:** Refactor regularly and write clean code from the start

### 3. Integration Issues
**Problem:** Individual components don't work together
**Solution:** Plan integration early and test frequently
