## Turning Requirements into Technical Details

Specifications take the general requirements and make them measurable, technical, and actionable. They answer "how well" and "how fast" rather than just "what."

## Writing Good Specifications

### Use SMART Criteria
- **Specific**: Clear and unambiguous
- **Measurable**: Can be tested and verified
- **Achievable**: Technically possible with available resources
- **Relevant**: Important to users and stakeholders
- **Time-bound**: Has clear deadlines

### Example Comparisons

‚ùå **Vague**: "The app should be secure"
‚úÖ **Specific**: "User passwords must be hashed using bcrypt with minimum 12 rounds, and all API calls must use HTTPS"

‚ùå **Unmeasurable**: "The app should handle lots of users"
‚úÖ **Measurable**: "The app must support 10,000 concurrent users with 99.9% uptime"
