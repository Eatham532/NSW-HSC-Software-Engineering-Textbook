# Requirements Definition üìã

## What Does Our App Need to Do?

Requirements definition is the foundation of every successful software project. This phase involves understanding the problem, talking to users, and clearly documenting what the software must accomplish.

## StudyBuddy Requirements Discovery

**Student Interviews Revealed:**

- "I forget assignment due dates"
- "I can't balance study time between subjects"  
- "I need reminders but not too many notifications"
- "I want to track my progress"

**Final Requirements List:**

- Add assignments with due dates
- Create study schedules for different subjects
- Send smart notifications (not spam!)
- Track completed tasks and study time
- Work offline (for students with limited data)
- Sync across phone and laptop

**Instagram's Early Requirements (2010):** Originally just "share square photos with filters." The simple, clear requirement led to focused development and massive success!

## Best Practices for Requirements

### 1. Talk to Real Users
Don't assume you know what users want. Interview them, observe how they currently solve the problem, and ask about their frustrations.

### 2. Be Specific but Flexible
Requirements should be clear enough to guide development but flexible enough to adapt as you learn more.

### 3. Prioritize Features
Not all requirements are equally important. Use techniques like:
- **Must Have**: Core features the app can't work without
- **Should Have**: Important features that add significant value
- **Could Have**: Nice-to-have features for future versions

### 4. Write User Stories
Format: "As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"

**Example:** "As a student, I want to receive assignment reminders so that I never miss a deadline."

## Common Requirements Mistakes

‚ùå **Too Vague**: "The app should be fast"
‚úÖ **Specific**: "The app should load in under 2 seconds"

‚ùå **Feature Creep**: Adding every possible feature
‚úÖ **Focused**: Start with core features that solve the main problem

‚ùå **No User Input**: Developers guessing what users want
‚úÖ **User-Centered**: Regular interviews and feedback sessions

## Questions to Ask

1. **Who** will use this software?
2. **What** problem does it solve?
3. **When** and **where** will it be used?
4. **Why** is this solution needed?
5. **How** do users currently solve this problem?
