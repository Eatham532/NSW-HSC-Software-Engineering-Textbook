# Year 11 â€” Programming Fundamentals

This module establishes the essential foundations of software engineering through practical Python programming. Designed for absolute beginners, it builds programming confidence by starting with software development processes before diving into code, ensuring students understand both the "why" and "how" of programming.

## Module Overview

Programming Fundamentals creates a solid foundation by teaching software engineering concepts alongside practical coding skills. The module progresses logically from understanding the software development lifecycle to designing algorithms, working with data, and finally implementing solutions in Python.

**Key focus areas:**

- Software development methodologies and collaboration tools
- Algorithm design and analysis techniques
- Data representation and structures
- Python implementation with testing and debugging

## Learning Outcomes

Students will develop the ability to:

- **Apply software development processes** including requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance (SE-11-01)

- **Design algorithms** using control structures, subprograms, and appropriate data structures (SE-11-02)

- **Represent data** using appropriate types and understand number systems (SE-11-03)

- **Use development tools** including IDEs, version control, and debugging techniques (SE-11-06)

- **Test software solutions** using systematic approaches and evaluate effectiveness (SE-11-07, SE-11-08)

## Chapters

### Chapter 1: Software Development

Introduction to the software development lifecycle, collaboration tools, and project management. Covers SDLC steps, Git version control, documentation practices, and Waterfall vs Agile methodologies.

### Chapter 2: Designing Algorithms

Algorithm design fundamentals including control structures, input/output analysis, pseudocode, flowcharts, subprograms, and algorithm analysis techniques.

### Chapter 3: Data for Software Engineering

Data representation concepts including number systems, data types, data dictionaries, and common data structures like arrays, lists, and hash tables.

### Chapter 4: Developing Solutions with Code

Python implementation of algorithms with focus on control structures, data structures, functions, debugging, testing strategies, and code quality evaluation.

## Implementation Philosophy

This module emphasizes **practical understanding through implementation**:

- Python-only approach for consistency and accessibility
- Progressive complexity from concepts to code
- Real-world examples with immediate applicability
- Systematic testing and debugging practices
- Documentation and code quality from day one

## Prerequisites

- No prior programming experience required
- Basic computer literacy (file management, web browsing)
- Willingness to learn through hands-on practice

## Getting Started

1. **Begin with Chapter 1** to understand software development processes

2. **Progress through Chapters 2-3** to build algorithmic and data thinking

3. **Complete with Chapter 4** to implement solutions in Python

The module is designed for sequential progression, with each chapter building upon previous concepts while introducing new practical skills.
