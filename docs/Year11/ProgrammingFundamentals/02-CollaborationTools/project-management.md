# Project Management

## Introduction

**Project management** in software development is like conducting an orchestra - you need to coordinate different people, skills, and resources to create something beautiful together. Modern software project management combines traditional project management principles with agile methodologies to deliver working software quickly while adapting to changing requirements.

Whether you're managing a team of 2 or 200, the fundamentals remain the same: clear communication, realistic planning, continuous adaptation, and delivering value to users.

/// details | Why Project Management Matters in Software üéØ
    type: important

**Real-world impact of good project management:**
- **Standish Group research shows** only 31% of software projects succeed without proper management
- **Projects with skilled project managers** are 2.5x more likely to succeed
- **Good planning reduces** development time by 25-40%
- **Clear communication prevents** 70% of project failures

**What happens without proper project management:**
- **Scope creep** - Projects grow beyond original requirements
- **Missed deadlines** - No realistic timeline or progress tracking
- **Team burnout** - Unrealistic expectations and poor workload distribution
- **Quality issues** - Rushed development without proper testing
- **Budget overruns** - No cost control or resource planning

Good project management isn't bureaucracy - it's the foundation that lets developers focus on creating great software!

Based on the analysis:

PRIMARY CHOICE: Jira Software
‚úÖ Excellent Scrum support (sprints, backlogs, burndown charts)
‚úÖ Strong integration with GitHub and development tools  
‚úÖ Robust issue tracking for bug management
‚úÖ Good reporting for stakeholder updates
‚úÖ Scales well if team grows
‚ùå Higher cost but justified by features needed

BUDGET ALTERNATIVE: GitHub Projects + Trello
‚úÖ Much lower cost (GitHub Projects free, Trello $5/user)
‚úÖ Simple setup and learning curve
‚úÖ Good enough for basic project tracking
‚ùå Limited advanced features and reporting
‚ùå Need to use multiple tools for complete solution

RECOMMENDATION: Start with Jira free tier (10 users) to test, then upgrade to Standard plan if needed.

/// details | Project Management Career Impact üíº
    type: tip

**Project management skills are highly valued:**
- **Technical project managers** earn 15-25% more than individual contributors
- **Agile expertise** is required for most senior development roles
- **Stakeholder communication** skills distinguish great developers from good ones
- **Project planning ability** is essential for technical leadership positions
- **Risk management experience** is crucial for senior and principal engineer roles

Learning project management makes you more valuable regardless of your technical specialty!
