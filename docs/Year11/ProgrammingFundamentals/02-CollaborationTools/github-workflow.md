# GitHub Workflow

## Introduction

**GitHub** is like the social media platform for programmers - but instead of sharing photos and posts, developers share code, collaborate on projects, and build amazing software together. GitHub takes Git's powerful version control and adds a beautiful web interface, collaboration tools, and a thriving community of millions of developers worldwide.

/// details | Why GitHub Rules the World üåç
    type: important

**GitHub's massive impact:**
- **100+ million developers** use GitHub worldwide
- **330+ million repositories** host everything from personal projects to enterprise applications
- **90% of Fortune 100 companies** use GitHub for development
- **Open source revolution** - Linux, React, TensorFlow all live on GitHub

**What GitHub adds to Git:**
- **Beautiful web interface** - See your code, history, and branches visually
- **Pull requests** - Propose changes and discuss them before merging
- **Issue tracking** - Manage bugs, features, and project tasks
- **Actions** - Automated testing, deployment, and workflows
- **Community features** - Discover projects, contribute to open source
- **Professional credibility** - Your GitHub profile is your developer portfolio
