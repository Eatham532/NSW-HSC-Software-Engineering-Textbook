## Software Development

**From Idea to App Store:** How do developers turn a simple idea like "I want to share photos with friends" into Instagram, or "I want to stream games" into Twitch? The secret is computational thinking and systematic development processes.

Computational thinking and algorithmic design are the foundation of effective problem-solving in programming. By breaking down complex problems into logical steps, programmers can create solutions that are efficient, reliable, and easy to maintain. Computational thinking involves analyzing problems, recognizing patterns, abstracting details, and designing algorithms that guide the coding process.

!!! tip "Real-World Success Story 🚀"
    **Netflix's Billion-Dollar Algorithm:** Netflix uses computational thinking to solve the massive problem of "What should 230 million people watch next?" They break it down into smaller problems:
    
    1. **Decomposition:** Split into user preferences, viewing history, and content analysis
    2. **Pattern Recognition:** Find similarities between users and content
    3. **Abstraction:** Focus on key factors (genre, actor, rating) while ignoring irrelevant details
    4. **Algorithms:** Create step-by-step processes to generate recommendations
    
    This systematic approach drives 80% of what people watch on Netflix!

### Fundamental Software Development Steps

Modern software development follows a structured approach that ensures quality and reliability. Understanding these steps helps programmers plan projects effectively and deliver successful solutions.

### Thinking Questions

1. How can clearly defined requirements improve the success of your software project?
2. Which SDLC phase do you think is most challenging, and why?
3. How would you apply these steps to a project you are currently working on or planning?

## Data for Software Engineering

Mastering data representation and structures is critical in software engineering because data is the foundation of every program. The way data is stored, processed, and organized directly impacts the efficiency, accuracy, and maintainability of software solutions. Understanding how to represent numbers, choose appropriate data types, and structure information allows programmers to solve problems more effectively and optimize their code for real-world applications. Whether handling user input, storing records, or processing large datasets, strong data skills are essential for building robust and scalable software.

### Number Systems

- **Binary**: The binary system uses only two digits, 0 and 1, and is the language of computers. Each binary digit (bit) represents an on or off state. *Example: 1011 in binary equals 11 in decimal.*
- **Decimal**: The decimal system is the standard system for denoting integer and non-integer numbers, using digits 0–9. *Example: 47 in decimal is written as 47.*
- **Hexadecimal**: The hexadecimal system uses sixteen symbols (0–9 and A–F) and is often used in computing for compact representation of binary data. *Example: 2A in hexadecimal equals 42 in decimal.*

**Conversions:**
```
Binary to Decimal: 1101₂ = 1×8 + 1×4 + 0×2 + 1×1 = 13₁₀
Decimal to Binary: 19₁₀ = 10011₂
Decimal to Hexadecimal: 255₁₀ = FF₁₆
Hexadecimal to Decimal: 1A₁₆ = 26₁₀
```

### Two’s Complement

Two’s complement is a method for representing signed integers in binary. Positive numbers are stored as usual, while negative numbers are represented by inverting all bits of the absolute value and adding one. This allows computers to perform arithmetic operations easily.

**Example:**
Convert -5 to 8-bit two’s complement:
1. Write 5 in binary:
    ```
    00000101
    ```
2. Invert the bits:
    ```
    11111010
    ```
3. Add 1:
    ```
    11111011
    ```
So, -5 in 8-bit two’s complement is:
    ```
    11111011
    ```

### Standard Data Types

- **char (character)**: Represents a single character. *Example: 'A'*
- **string**: A sequence of characters. *Example: "Hello, world!"*
- **Boolean**: Represents true or false values. *Example: isActive = true*
- **real / single-precision floating point**: Represents numbers with decimals. *Example: pi = 3.14159*
- **integer**: Whole numbers without decimals. *Example: count = 42*
- **date and time**: Stores calendar dates and times. *Example: birthday = 2025-08-01 14:30*

### Data Dictionaries

A data dictionary is a structured table that defines the attributes of data used in a program, including name, type, size, and description. It helps programmers understand and manage data, and captures relationships between different data elements.

**Example Data Dictionary:**

| Name      | Type     | Size | Description                |
|-----------|----------|------|----------------------------|
| userID    | integer  | 4    | Unique identifier for user |
| username  | string   | 20   | User’s login name          |
| isActive  | Boolean  | 1    | Account status             |
| birthday  | date     | 8    | User’s date of birth       |

### Data Structures

- **Array**: A collection of elements of the same type, stored in a fixed-size sequence. Useful for lists of items, like scores or names.
- **Record**: A data structure that groups related fields, often of different types. Used for storing complex data, like a student’s name, age, and grade.
- **Tree**: A hierarchical structure with nodes connected by edges, useful for representing relationships like file systems or organizational charts.
- **Sequential File**: Stores data records in a specific order, often used for simple databases or log files where data is processed in sequence.

### Key Learning Outcomes

- Understand binary, decimal, and hexadecimal number systems and conversions
- Explain two’s complement representation for signed integers
- Identify and use standard data types in programming
- Structure and interpret data dictionaries
- Select appropriate data structures for different tasks

### Reflection Questions

1. How does choosing the right data structure affect the performance of your program?
2. Why is it important to document data using a data dictionary?
3. How could poor data representation lead to errors or inefficiencies in software?

## Designing Algorithms

Algorithm design is at the heart of computational thinking, enabling programmers to break down complex problems into manageable steps. By carefully planning the logic and flow of a solution, programmers can create efficient, reliable code that solves real-world challenges. Computational thinking involves understanding the problem, identifying patterns, abstracting details, and designing algorithms that are both clear and effective. Mastering algorithmic design helps programmers approach tasks methodically, anticipate potential issues, and build solutions that are easy to test, debug, and maintain.

### Key Concepts

- **Sequence**: Instructions are executed one after another in a specific order. Sequence forms the backbone of all algorithms.
  ```
  // Pseudocode for sequence
  input number
  double = number * 2
  print double
  ```

- **Selection**: Decisions are made based on conditions, allowing the algorithm to choose different paths.
  ```
  // Pseudocode for selection
  if score >= 50 then
      print "Pass"
  else
      print "Fail"
  end if
  ```

- **Iteration**: Repeats a set of instructions until a condition is met, useful for tasks like searching or counting.
  ```
  // Pseudocode for iteration
  for i = 1 to 10
      print i
  end for
  ```

- **Divide and Conquer**: Breaks a problem into smaller subproblems, solves each recursively, and combines results. Used in sorting algorithms like merge sort. *Example: Searching for a name in a sorted phone book by repeatedly dividing the book in half until the name is found.*
- **Backtracking**: Explores possible solutions by trying options and undoing steps if a dead end is reached. Common in puzzles and games. *Example: Solving a Sudoku puzzle by filling in numbers and backtracking when a conflict arises.*

### Developing Structured Algorithms

Writing structured algorithms involves using pseudocode and flowcharts to plan logic before coding. For example, a subprogram to calculate the area of a rectangle:


**Pseudocode:**
```
function calculateArea(length, width)
    area = length * width
    return area
end function
```

**Flowchart:**
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[Input length, width]
    B --> C[Calculate area]
    C --> D[Output area]
    D --> E[End]
```

Structure charts, abstraction, and refinement diagrams help visualize how a program is organized. Top-down design breaks problems into smaller tasks, while bottom-up design builds solutions from reusable components. Abstraction focuses on essential details, ignoring unnecessary complexity, and refinement diagrams show how high-level tasks are decomposed into subroutines.

### Analysing Algorithms

- **Determining inputs and outputs**: Identify what data the algorithm needs and what results it should produce.
- **Determining the purpose of the algorithm**: Clarify what problem the algorithm solves and its intended outcome.
- **Desk-checking and peer-checking**: Manually trace the algorithm with sample data and review with peers to catch errors.
- **Mapping connections to other routines**: Document how the algorithm interacts with subroutines or functions for modularity and reuse.

### Programming Paradigms

Experimenting with different programming paradigms broadens problem-solving skills:

- **Object-oriented**: Model real-world entities as objects.
    - *Example: A `Car` class with properties and methods.*
- **Imperative**: Focus on step-by-step instructions.
    - *Example: Calculating the sum of a list using a loop.*
- **Logic**: Use rules and facts to infer solutions.
    - *Example: Determining family relationships in Prolog.*
- **Functional**: Emphasize pure functions and immutability.
    - *Example: Mapping a function to double each number in a list.*

### Key Learning Outcomes

- Understand the role of computational thinking in algorithm design
- Apply sequence, selection, iteration, divide and conquer, and backtracking in algorithms
- Develop structured algorithms using pseudocode, flowcharts, and diagrams
- Analyse algorithms for inputs, outputs, and purpose

3. How could you apply top-down or bottom-up design to a project of your own?

## Developing Solutions with Code

Programming is the practical application of computational thinking, transforming ideas and algorithms into working software solutions. By combining logical reasoning, problem decomposition, and coding skills, programmers can build applications that solve real-world problems. Effective software development requires not only writing code, but also planning, testing, debugging, and evaluating solutions to ensure they meet user needs and perform reliably. Mastering these practices helps programmers create maintainable, efficient, and high-quality software.

### From Algorithm to Code

Converting an algorithm into code involves translating logical steps into programming constructs. For example, consider an algorithm to find the maximum value in a list:


**Algorithm:**

1. Set `max` to the first value in the list.
2. For each value in the list:
    - If value > `max`, set `max` = value.
3. Output `max`.

**Flowchart:**
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[Set max to first value in list]
    B --> C[For each value in the list]
    C --> D{Is value > max?}
    D -- Yes --> E[Set max = value]
    D -- No --> F[Continue]
    E --> F
    F --> G[Output max]
    G --> H[End]
```

**Python Code Example:**
```python
def find_max(numbers):
    max_value = numbers[0]
    for value in numbers:
        if value > max_value:
            max_value = value
    return max_value

result = find_max([3, 7, 2, 9, 5])
print(result)
```

This code uses control structures (for loop, if statement), a data structure (list), and a subprogram (function with parameter passing).

**Data Structures Implementation:**

- **Single-dimensional array/list:**
  ```python
  scores = [85, 90, 78, 92]
  ```
- **Multidimensional array (matrix):**
  ```python
  matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
  ```
- **Tree (simple binary tree node):**
  ```python
  class Node:
      def __init__(self, value):
          self.value = value
          self.left = None
          self.right = None
  ```
- **Stack:**
  ```python
  stack = []
  stack.append(5)
  stack.pop()
  ```
- **Hash table (dictionary):**
  ```python
  phone_book = {"Alice": "1234", "Bob": "5678"}
  ```

### Project Management Models

- **Waterfall Model:**
  A linear, sequential approach where each phase (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment) is completed before the next begins. Changes are difficult once a phase is finished.
  
  **Diagram:**
  ```mermaid
  graph TD
    A[Requirements] --> B[Design]
    B --> C[Implementation]
    C --> D[Testing]
    D --> E[Deployment]
  ```

- **Agile Model:**
  An iterative, flexible approach where development occurs in short cycles (sprints), allowing for frequent feedback and adaptation. Teams collaborate closely and respond quickly to changes.
  
  **Diagram:**
  ```mermaid
  graph LR
    A[Plan] --> B[Design]
    B --> C[Build]
    C --> D[Test]
    D --> E[Review]
    E --> A[Plan]
  ```

### Testing and Evaluation

Testing involves selecting appropriate data sets to ensure code works as intended:
- **Boundary values:** Test at the limits of valid input (e.g., min/max values).
- **Path coverage:** Ensure all possible execution paths are tested.
- **Faulty/abnormal inputs:** Test with incorrect or unexpected data to check error handling.

Evaluation criteria include:
- **Functionality:** Does the solution meet requirements?
- **Performance:** Is it efficient and responsive?
- **Code readability:** Is the code clear and easy to understand?
- **Documentation quality:** Are comments and documentation thorough and helpful?

### Debugging Techniques

Debugging tools and methods help identify and fix errors:

- **Breakpoints:** Pause execution at specific lines to inspect state.
- **Single-line stepping:** Execute code one line at a time to trace logic.
- **Watches:** Monitor variable values during execution.
- **Interface checks:** Verify user interface elements behave as expected.
- **Debug output statements:** Print values and messages to track program flow.
- **IDE debugging features:** Use integrated development environment tools for advanced debugging.

### Common Error Types

- **Syntax errors:** Mistakes in code structure (e.g., missing colon). *Example: `if x = 5 print(x)` — missing colon and incorrect assignment.*
- **Logic errors:** Code runs but produces incorrect results (e.g., wrong formula). *Example: Calculating average as `total * count` instead of `total / count`.*
- **Runtime errors:** Errors that occur during execution (e.g., dividing by zero). *Example: `print(10 / 0)` — division by zero causes a crash.*
