# 07.02 Computing Hardware - Quiz

!!! quiz "Section 7.2 Quiz: Computing hardware"

    1. What is the main advantage of using a microcontroller instead of a CPU in a mechatronic system?
        - Microcontrollers are faster than CPUs
        - Microcontrollers use less power and are designed for specific control tasks {data-correct}
        - Microcontrollers have more memory than CPUs
        - Microcontrollers can run complex operating systems

    2. What does an opcode represent?
        - The speed at which a processor runs
        - A numerical code that represents a specific instruction the processor can execute {data-correct}
        - The amount of memory a processor has
        - The number of registers in a processor

    3. Which of the following is NOT a typical type of processor register?
        - Accumulator
        - Program Counter
        - Instruction Register
        - Memory Bank {data-correct}

    4. In the fetch-decode-execute cycle, what happens during the "decode" step?
        - The processor gets the instruction from memory
        - The processor figures out what the instruction means and what to do {data-correct}
        - The processor carries out the instruction
        - The processor moves to the next instruction

    5. What type of instruction set do most microcontrollers use, and why?
        - CISC, because it has more complex instructions
        - RISC, because the simple instructions execute quickly and efficiently {data-correct}
        - Both RISC and CISC equally
        - Neither, they use a completely different system

    6. If a processor has a clock speed of 16 MHz, approximately how many instruction cycles can it complete per second?
        - 16 thousand
        - 160 thousand  
        - 16 million {data-correct}
        - 16 billion

    7. In our SimpleProcessor example, what would happen if you executed "LOAD 25" followed by "ADD 10"?
        - The accumulator would contain 25
        - The accumulator would contain 10
        - The accumulator would contain 35 {data-correct}
        - The program would crash

    8. Why might understanding instruction timing be important for mechatronic systems?
        - It helps you choose cheaper components
        - It ensures your control system can respond quickly enough for real-time requirements {data-correct}
        - It makes your code easier to read
        - It reduces the amount of memory needed
