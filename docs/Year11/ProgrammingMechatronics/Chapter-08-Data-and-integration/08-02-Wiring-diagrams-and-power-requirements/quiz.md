!!! quiz "Section 8.2 Quiz: Wiring diagrams and power requirements"

    1. What is the power consumption of a servo motor operating at 6V and drawing 1.5A?
        - 4.0W
        - 7.5W
        - 9.0W {data-correct}
        - 10.5W

    2. Which wire colour is conventionally used for ground connections in DC circuits?
        - Red
        - Black {data-correct}
        - Blue
        - Yellow

    3. A system draws 3A from a 12V battery. What is the minimum fuse rating needed with a 25% safety margin?
        - 3A
        - 3.75A {data-correct}
        - 4.5A
        - 5A

    4. Why do we typically only use 80% of a battery's rated capacity in runtime calculations?
        - To account for manufacturing tolerances
        - To prevent complete discharge and extend battery life {data-correct}
        - Because batteries lose capacity over time
        - To reduce system weight

    5. A mobile robot has the following components: microcontroller (5V, 0.5A), two motors (12V, 2A each), and sensors (5V, 0.2A). What is the total power consumption?
        - 51.6W {data-correct}
        - 48.0W
        - 45.5W
        - 53.2W

    6. Which of the following are essential safety practices for mechatronic wiring? (Select all that apply)
        - Using appropriate wire gauge for current capacity {data-correct}
        - Installing fuses on power circuits {data-correct}
        - Colour coding wires consistently {data-correct}
        - Using the highest voltage possible for all components

    7. A robot system consumes 2.5A continuously. How long will it operate on a 4Ah battery, assuming 80% usable capacity?
        - 1.28 hours {data-correct}
        - 1.6 hours
        - 2.0 hours
        - 3.2 hours

    8. What does Ohm's Law describe?
        - The relationship between power and current
        - The relationship between voltage, current, and resistance {data-correct}
        - The relationship between battery capacity and runtime
        - The relationship between wire gauge and current capacity
