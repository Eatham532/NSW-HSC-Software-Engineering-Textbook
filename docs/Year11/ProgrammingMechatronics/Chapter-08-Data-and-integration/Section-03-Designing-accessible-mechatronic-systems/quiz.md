!!! quiz "Section 8.3 Quiz: Designing accessible mechatronic systems"

    1. Which principle of universal design focuses on minimising hazards from accidental actions?
        - Equitable use
        - Flexibility in use
        - Simple and intuitive use
        - Tolerance for error {data-correct}

    2. What is the recommended optimal height range for controls to accommodate wheelchair users?
        - 380-600mm from floor
        - 600-1000mm from floor {data-correct}
        - 1000-1220mm from floor
        - 1220-1800mm from floor

    3. For users with limited grip strength, what is the maximum recommended activation force for controls?
        - 10 Newtons
        - 22 Newtons {data-correct}
        - 35 Newtons
        - 50 Newtons

    4. Which of the following are essential components of an accessible emergency stop system? (Select all that apply)
        - Multiple stop button locations {data-correct}
        - Voice command activation {data-correct}
        - Low force activation requirements {data-correct}
        - Complex authentication procedures

    5. What does "dwell time" refer to in eye tracking interfaces?
        - The time between eye movements
        - How long a user must look at a target to activate it {data-correct}
        - The delay before the system responds
        - The time needed to calibrate the system

    6. Why is multi-modal feedback important in accessible mechatronic systems?
        - It reduces power consumption
        - It accommodates users with different sensory abilities {data-correct}
        - It makes the system look more advanced
        - It simplifies the programming requirements

    7. In the context of accessible design, what is the purpose of "force limiting" in safety systems?
        - To reduce power consumption
        - To prevent damage to mechanical components
        - To protect users who may have reduced sensation or awareness {data-correct}
        - To comply with noise regulations

    8. Which accessibility consideration is most important for long-term system usability?
        - Initial cost reduction
        - User-adjustable settings that can change as needs evolve {data-correct}
        - Standardised interface colours
        - Minimum training requirements
