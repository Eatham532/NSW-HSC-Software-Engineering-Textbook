# 10.01 Simulations And Prototypes For Testing - Quiz

!!! quiz "Section 10.1 Quiz: Simulations and prototypes for testing"

    1. Why is simulation important in mechatronic system development?
        - It's faster than building real hardware
        - It allows safe testing of control algorithms before using real devices {data-correct}
        - It's cheaper than buying components
        - All of the above {data-correct}

    2. Which of these is NOT a realistic characteristic that should be included in sensor simulation?
        - Random noise in readings
        - Response time delays
        - Perfect accuracy with no measurement errors {data-correct}
        - Measurement range limits

    3. In the temperature sensor simulation example, what causes the sensor readings to change over time?
        - Random noise only
        - Gradual drift only
        - Both random noise and cumulative drift {data-correct}
        - Temperature changes in the environment

    4. What is the purpose of the `update()` method in actuator simulations?
        - To instantly move the actuator to its target position
        - To simulate realistic movement over time with speed constraints {data-correct}
        - To check if the actuator is connected properly
        - To reset the actuator to its starting position

    5. In the servo motor simulation, what happens if you command it to move to an angle it's already at?
        - It moves anyway to ensure accuracy
        - It reports an error
        - It recognizes it's already at the target and doesn't move {data-correct}
        - It moves to the opposite angle

    6. What is forward kinematics in the context of the robotic arm simulation?
        - Calculating what joint angles are needed to reach a target position
        - Calculating the end effector position from known joint angles {data-correct}
        - Moving the arm forward in a straight line
        - Checking if a position is reachable

    7. In the pick-and-place robot example, what is the typical sequence for picking up an object?
        - Close gripper, move to object, lower arm, lift object
        - Move above object, open gripper, lower to object, close gripper, lift {data-correct}
        - Move to object, close gripper, check if successful
        - Open gripper, close gripper, move to object

    8. What is a key advantage of using Python classes for component simulation?
        - Classes run faster than functions
        - Classes allow you to model state and behaviour together {data-correct}
        - Classes are required for all simulations
        - Classes automatically handle hardware connections

    9. In a realistic actuator simulation, which factor would affect how quickly it reaches its target position?
        - The target position value
        - The maximum speed of the actuator {data-correct}
        - The number of other actuators in the system
        - The type of sensor being used

    10. What is the main purpose of the system integration simulation examples?
        - To show how individual components work in isolation
        - To demonstrate how sensors and actuators work together in feedback loops {data-correct}
        - To test the speed of Python code
        - To replace the need for real hardware entirely
