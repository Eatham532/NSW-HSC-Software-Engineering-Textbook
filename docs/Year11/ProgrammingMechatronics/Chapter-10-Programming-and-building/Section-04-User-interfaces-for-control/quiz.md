# 10.4 Quiz: User interfaces for control

!!! quiz "Section 10.4 Quiz: User interfaces for control"

    1. What is a key advantage of using CLI (Command Line Interface) for mechatronic systems?
        - CLIs are more visually appealing than graphical interfaces
        - CLIs can be easily automated with scripts and provide precise control {data-correct}
        - CLIs require less programming knowledge to create
        - CLIs work better on touchscreen devices

    2. Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of good error messages in mechatronic systems?
        - Clear and easy to understand
        - Specific about what went wrong
        - Written in technical jargon for accuracy {data-correct}
        - Actionable with suggested solutions

    3. In the dashboard example, what type of information should be displayed most prominently?
        - Historical data and trends
        - Safety alerts and critical system status {data-correct}
        - User preferences and settings
        - Detailed technical specifications

    4. What is the primary purpose of progress bars in mechatronic control interfaces?
        - To make the interface look more modern
        - To show current values relative to safe operating ranges {data-correct}
        - To display historical performance data
        - To indicate system processing speed

    5. Which message severity level should be used when a sensor reading approaches but hasn't exceeded its safety limit?
        - INFO
        - WARNING {data-correct}
        - ERROR
        - CRITICAL

    6. In the sorting system interface example, what happens when the emergency stop is activated?
        - The system reduces speed to 50%
        - The system continues running but logs the event
        - All motion halts immediately and the system cannot restart until reset {data-correct}
        - The system switches to manual control mode

    7. What makes a status indicator effective for mechatronic systems?
        - Using many different colors and animations
        - Providing consistent symbols and immediate visual feedback {data-correct}
        - Displaying as much technical detail as possible
        - Requiring users to click for more information

    8. When designing a CLI command structure, which approach is most user-friendly?
        - Using single-letter commands to save typing time
        - Using descriptive command names with optional parameters and help text {data-correct}
        - Requiring users to memorize numeric codes for each function
        - Making all commands case-sensitive for precision

    9. What should happen when a user enters an invalid command in a well-designed CLI?
        - The system should shut down to prevent errors
        - The system should guess what the user meant and execute that
        - The system should provide clear error message and suggest valid alternatives {data-correct}
        - The system should ignore the command silently

    10. In the greenhouse dashboard example, why are target values shown alongside current sensor readings?
        - To make the interface look more complete
        - To help users quickly identify if values are within acceptable ranges {data-correct}
        - To display the maximum possible sensor values
        - To show what the sensors were reading yesterday
