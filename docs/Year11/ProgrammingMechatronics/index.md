# Year 11 â€” Programming Mechatronics

This module explores the integration of mechanical, electrical, and software systems through mechatronics, teaching students how to design and program intelligent systems that interact with the physical world. Using Python simulations and conceptual understanding, it prepares students for real-world hardware integration.

## Module Overview

Mechatronics combines mechanical engineering, electronics, and software to create intelligent systems. This module teaches the principles of mechatronic design, focusing on sensors, actuators, control algorithms, and system integration through Python programming and simulation.

**Key focus areas:**

- Mechatronic system components and applications

- Data handling and electrical integration

- Control algorithms and autonomous systems

- Python simulations and testing approaches

## Learning Outcomes

Students will develop the ability to:

- **Understand mechatronic components** including sensors, actuators, computing hardware, and their characteristics (SE-11-03)

- **Work with device data** including logging, diagnostics, and data interpretation (SE-11-04)

- **Design accessible systems** considering usability, safety, and inclusive design principles (SE-11-05)

- **Implement control algorithms** using programming constructs and feedback systems (SE-11-02)

- **Test mechatronic solutions** through simulation and systematic testing approaches (SE-11-06, SE-11-07)
