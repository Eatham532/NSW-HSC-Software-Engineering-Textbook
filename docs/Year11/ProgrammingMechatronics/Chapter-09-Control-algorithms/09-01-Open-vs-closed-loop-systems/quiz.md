# 09.01 Open Vs Closed Loop Systems - Quiz

!!! quiz "Section 9.1 Quiz: Open vs closed loop systems"

    1. What is the main difference between open loop and closed loop control systems?
        - Open loop systems are faster than closed loop systems
        - Open loop systems use feedback while closed loop systems don't
        - Closed loop systems use feedback while open loop systems don't {data-correct}
        - There is no significant difference between them

    2. Which of the following is an example of an open loop system?
        - Cruise control in a car
        - Thermostat controlling room temperature
        - Microwave oven heating for a set time {data-correct}
        - Automatic focus camera

    3. What type of feedback is most commonly used in control systems to maintain stability?
        - Positive feedback
        - Negative feedback {data-correct}
        - Neutral feedback
        - Variable feedback

    4. In a closed loop system, what happens when the control gain is set too high?
        - The system responds too slowly
        - The system becomes more stable
        - The system may oscillate or become unstable {data-correct}
        - The system uses less energy

    5. Which statement about open loop systems is correct?
        - They automatically adjust to disturbances
        - They are more expensive than closed loop systems
        - They cannot correct for errors or disturbances {data-correct}
        - They always provide better accuracy

    6. In the cruise control example, what would happen if the system operated in open loop mode on a steep hill?
        - The speed would be maintained perfectly
        - The speed would likely decrease due to gravity {data-correct}
        - The system would automatically increase throttle
        - The car would accelerate uncontrollably

    7. What is a key advantage of closed loop systems over open loop systems?
        - Lower cost
        - Simpler design
        - Ability to correct for disturbances {data-correct}
        - Faster response time

    8. Which factor does NOT typically affect system stability in closed loop control?
        - Control gain
        - System delays
        - The color of the system housing {data-correct}
        - External disturbances
