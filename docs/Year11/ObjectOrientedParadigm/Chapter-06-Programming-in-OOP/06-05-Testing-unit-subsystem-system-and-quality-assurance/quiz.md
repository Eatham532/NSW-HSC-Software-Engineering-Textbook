# 06.05 Testing Unit Subsystem System And Quality Assurance - Quiz

!!! quiz "Check your understanding"

    1. What is the primary purpose of unit testing in object-oriented programming?

        - To test the entire system from end to end
        - To test individual methods and classes in isolation { data-correct }
        - To test user interface components
        - To test database connections

    2. Which characteristic is most important for a good unit test?

        - It should test multiple classes at once
        - It should connect to external databases
        - It should be independent and repeatable { data-correct }
        - It should take several minutes to run

    3. In the Python unittest framework, what is the purpose of the `setUp` method?

        - To clean up after all tests are complete
        - To configure test fixtures before each test method runs { data-correct }
        - To run the actual test logic
        - To generate test reports

    4. What type of testing focuses on verifying that different classes work correctly when combined?

        - Unit testing
        - System testing
        - Subsystem (integration) testing { data-correct }
        - Acceptance testing

    5. Which assertion would be most appropriate to test that a method raises a specific exception?

        - `self.assertEqual(exception, ValueError)`
        - `self.assertTrue(method_raises_error())`
        - `with self.assertRaises(ValueError): method_call()` { data-correct }
        - `self.assertIsNone(method_call())`

    6. What is the main focus of system testing?

        - Testing individual methods in isolation
        - Testing complete user workflows and business requirements { data-correct }
        - Testing only error conditions
        - Testing code performance and speed

    7. In Test-Driven Development (TDD), when should you write the tests?

        - After implementing all the functionality
        - Before implementing the functionality { data-correct }
        - Only when bugs are discovered
        - At the end of the project

    8. What should a good code review checklist for object-oriented code include?

        - Only syntax and formatting rules
        - Single responsibility, encapsulation, clear naming, and test coverage { data-correct }
        - Only performance optimization checks
        - Only documentation requirements

    9. Which of the following best describes acceptance criteria?

        - Technical specifications for developers only
        - Performance benchmarks for system speed
        - Clear definitions of when features are considered complete and working { data-correct }
        - Documentation standards for code comments

    10. What is the most important benefit of maintaining a continuous testing mindset?

        - It reduces the need for documentation
        - It catches problems early and builds confidence in code changes { data-correct }
        - It eliminates the need for code reviews
        - It makes development faster by skipping planning phases
