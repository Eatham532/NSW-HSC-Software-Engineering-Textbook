!!! quiz "Check your understanding"

    1. What is the main characteristic of black box testing?

        - Tests are designed by examining the internal code structure
        - Tests are designed based on specifications without knowing internal implementation { data-correct }
        - Tests require partial knowledge of the system architecture
        - Tests focus only on error conditions

    2. Which testing technique is most commonly used in black box testing to test boundary conditions?

        - Statement coverage analysis
        - Path coverage analysis
        - Boundary value analysis { data-correct }
        - Code inspection

    3. What is the primary goal of white box testing?

        - To verify that the system meets user requirements
        - To ensure all code paths, statements, and conditions are tested { data-correct }
        - To test the system from an external user perspective
        - To validate business logic without seeing code

    4. In equivalence partitioning, what principle guides the selection of test cases?

        - Test every possible input value
        - Test only boundary values
        - Test representative values from each group of inputs that should behave similarly { data-correct }
        - Test only the most complex scenarios

    5. When would grey box testing be most appropriate?

        - When testing individual methods in isolation
        - When testing system integration with some knowledge of internal architecture { data-correct }
        - When testing without any knowledge of the system
        - When testing only user interface components

    6. Which of the following is a white box testing technique?

        - Equivalence partitioning
        - Boundary value analysis
        - Statement coverage analysis { data-correct }
        - User acceptance testing

    7. For a password validation function with the requirement "8-20 characters, at least one uppercase, one lowercase, one digit", which represents the best black box test approach?

        - Test only with valid passwords
        - Test boundary conditions for length and character requirements { data-correct }
        - Examine the validation code and test all conditional branches
        - Test only the most common password patterns

    8. What advantage does white box testing provide over black box testing?

        - It ensures the system meets user requirements
        - It can identify untested code paths and dead code { data-correct }
        - It tests the system from a user perspective
        - It requires less technical knowledge

    9. In the context of testing an e-commerce checkout process, what would be a grey box testing approach?

        - Testing only the user interface workflow
        - Testing all internal database queries and transactions
        - Testing payment processing with knowledge of the security mechanisms used { data-correct }
        - Testing without any knowledge of the system architecture

    10. Which testing strategy would be most effective for ensuring that all conditional statements in a complex algorithm are properly tested?

        - Black box testing with equivalence partitioning
        - White box testing with branch coverage { data-correct }
        - Grey box testing with architectural knowledge
        - Random testing with automated tools
