# 06.07 Code Optimisation And Assessing Effectiveness - Quiz

!!! quiz "Check your understanding"

    1. Which four dimensions are used to assess code effectiveness?

        - Speed, memory, disk space, network usage
        - Correctness, clarity, performance, maintainability { data-correct }
        - Syntax, logic, structure, documentation
        - Input, processing, output, storage

    2. What is the principle of "avoiding premature optimization"?

        - Never optimize code under any circumstances
        - Optimize everything from the beginning to save time later
        - Don't optimize until you know where the bottlenecks actually are { data-correct }
        - Only optimize code that looks complex

    3. Which data structure choice would provide the best performance for frequent membership testing (checking if an item exists)?

        - List
        - Set { data-correct }
        - Tuple
        - String

    4. What is the most effective type of optimization for improving algorithm performance?

        - Using shorter variable names
        - Removing comments and whitespace
        - Choosing algorithms with better time complexity { data-correct }
        - Using more advanced language features

    5. When should you prioritize code readability over performance optimization?

        - Never - performance is always most important
        - When the performance gain is minimal and the code is not a bottleneck { data-correct }
        - Only in prototype code
        - When using interpreted languages

    6. What is the primary purpose of profiling code?

        - To check for syntax errors
        - To identify actual performance bottlenecks before optimizing { data-correct }
        - To count the number of lines of code
        - To verify code correctness

    7. Which of the following demonstrates better maintainability?

        - All code in one large method to avoid method call overhead
        - Code separated into focused methods with clear responsibilities { data-correct }
        - Using single-letter variable names to save typing
        - Avoiding comments to keep code concise

    8. In the context of Big O notation, which represents the best time complexity for a search algorithm?

        - O(nÂ²)
        - O(n log n)
        - O(n)
        - O(1) { data-correct }

    9. What should you do first when you suspect a performance problem in your code?

        - Immediately start rewriting the slowest-looking parts
        - Profile the code to measure where time is actually spent { data-correct }
        - Switch to a faster programming language
        - Add more comments to understand the code better

    10. Which approach best balances all four dimensions of code effectiveness?

        - Write the fastest possible code regardless of readability
        - Focus only on making code work correctly, ignore other factors
        - Write clear, correct code first, then optimize identified bottlenecks { data-correct }
        - Optimize everything from the start to avoid later rewrites
