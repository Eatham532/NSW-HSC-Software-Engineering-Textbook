!!! quiz "Check your understanding"

    1. What is the primary purpose of a class diagram?

        - To show data flow through a system
        - To show the static structure of classes and their relationships { data-correct }
        - To show the functional hierarchy
        - To show user interactions

    2. In PlantUML class diagrams, what does the symbol `||--o{` represent?

        - Inheritance relationship
        - One-to-many composition { data-correct }
        - Many-to-many association
        - Dependency relationship

    3. What type of diagram would be best for showing how a complex task breaks down into simpler subtasks?

        - Class diagram
        - Structure chart { data-correct }
        - Data flow diagram
        - Entity relationship diagram

    4. In a Data Flow Diagram, what do circles represent?

        - Data stores
        - External entities
        - Processes that transform data { data-correct }
        - Data flows

    5. Look at this PlantUML notation. What relationship does it show?

        ```
        class Student extends Person
        ```

        - Composition
        - Association
        - Inheritance { data-correct }
        - Aggregation

    6. What is the main focus of a Data Flow Diagram?

        - Object relationships
        - Functional decomposition
        - How data moves and transforms through a system { data-correct }
        - User interface design

    7. Which diagram type would be most appropriate for showing that a "School" contains multiple "Students"?

        - Structure chart
        - Data flow diagram
        - Class diagram { data-correct }
        - Sequence diagram

    8. In DFD notation, what do open rectangles typically represent?

        - Processes
        - Data stores { data-correct }
        - External entities
        - Data flows

    9. What is a Level 0 DFD also called?

        - Process diagram
        - Context diagram { data-correct }
        - System diagram
        - Flow chart

    10. Which combination of diagrams provides the most complete view of a system design?

        - Only class diagrams
        - Only structure charts
        - Only data flow diagrams
        - Class diagrams, structure charts, and DFDs together { data-correct }
