# 05.04 Comparing Procedural And Oop - Quiz

!!! quiz "Check your understanding"

    1. What is the main difference between procedural and object-oriented programming?

        - Procedural is faster than OOP
        - Procedural uses functions while OOP uses classes
        - Procedural organizes code as functions operating on data, while OOP bundles data and methods together { data-correct }
        - OOP is always better than procedural

    2. Which programming approach would be best for a simple temperature conversion program?

        - Object-oriented programming
        - Procedural programming { data-correct }
        - Both are equally good
        - Neither approach works

    3. Look at this code. What approach does it represent?

        ```python
        def calculate_area(length, width):
            return length * width

        def calculate_perimeter(length, width):
            return 2 * (length + width)
        ```text

        - Object-oriented programming
        - Procedural programming { data-correct }
        - Functional programming
        - Event-driven programming

    4. When would object-oriented programming be the better choice?

        - For simple mathematical calculations
        - For modeling real-world entities with complex state { data-correct }
        - For processing a single list of data
        - For basic input/output operations

    5. What is a key advantage of procedural programming?

        - Better code reuse through inheritance
        - Encapsulation of data
        - Simplicity and directness for straightforward problems { data-correct }
        - Polymorphism support

    6. In object-oriented programming, what replaces global variables for storing data?

        - Function parameters
        - Object attributes { data-correct }
        - Return values
        - Local variables

    7. Which scenario would benefit most from object-oriented programming?

        - Calculating the average of numbers in a list
        - A video game with players, enemies, and items { data-correct }
        - Converting text to uppercase
        - Finding the maximum value in an array

    8. What is the first step when converting procedural code to object-oriented?

        - Create inheritance hierarchies
        - Add polymorphism
        - Identify data that belongs together { data-correct }
        - Write more functions

    9. Which statement about trade-offs between paradigms is correct?

        - OOP is always more efficient than procedural
        - Procedural programming is always easier to maintain
        - OOP provides better modularity for complex systems { data-correct }
        - There are no trade-offs between paradigms

    10. Look at this code structure. What principle does it demonstrate?

        ```python
        class Student:
            def \_\_init\_\_(self, name):
                self.name = name
                self.grades = []

            def add_grade(self, grade):
                self.grades.append(grade)
        ```text

        - Functions operating on separate data
        - Data and methods bundled together { data-correct }
        - Global variable usage
        - Procedural decomposition
