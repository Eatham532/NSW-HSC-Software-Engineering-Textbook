PlantUML rendering options

1) Kroki (recommended): no local JAR, uses Kroki server to render diagrams. Configure `kroki` plugin and ensure network access to Kroki.

2) Local PlantUML JAR: use `mkdocs-plantuml` plugin and provide a path to the PlantUML JAR; this runs locally but requires Java and the JAR.

Tell me which you'd prefer and I will add exact config and install steps.
