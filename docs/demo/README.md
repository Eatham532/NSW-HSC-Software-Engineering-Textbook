Demo pages for the MkDocs build.

- `quiz-demo.md` is a simple interactive quiz demo that uses `docs/assets/interactive-quiz.js` and `docs/assets/interactive-quiz.css`.
- To view: build the site with MkDocs and open the Demo -> Interactive Quiz page.

Notes:
- The interactive JS is purely client-side and only reveals the answer key; it does not collect or send any data.
- Mermaid support was removed from the site configuration; use PlantUML in Module pages if you enable Kroki or PlantUML plugin.
