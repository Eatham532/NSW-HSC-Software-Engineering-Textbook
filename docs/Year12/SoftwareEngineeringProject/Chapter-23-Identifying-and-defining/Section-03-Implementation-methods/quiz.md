# 23.3 Implementation methods: direct, phased, parallel, pilot - Quiz

!!! quiz "Check your understanding"

    1. What is the main characteristic of direct implementation?

        - Systems are implemented gradually over several months
        - Old and new systems run simultaneously for comparison
        - The old system is completely replaced in a single changeover { data-correct }
        - A small group tests the system before full deployment

    2. Which implementation method provides the highest level of safety for critical systems?

        - Direct implementation
        - Phased implementation
        - Parallel implementation { data-correct }
        - Pilot implementation

    3. What is the primary advantage of phased implementation?

        - Fastest time to full deployment
        - Lowest cost due to single transition
        - Manageable complexity through incremental delivery { data-correct }
        - Immediate feedback from all users

    4. In a pilot implementation, what is the most important factor when selecting the pilot group?

        - Choosing the largest possible group to maximise feedback
        - Selecting users who are representative of the broader user base { data-correct }
        - Picking only expert users who won't encounter problems
        - Including all senior management for approval purposes

    5. What does WAgile methodology combine?

        - Waterfall planning with rapid prototyping
        - Agile sprints with traditional testing methods
        - Waterfall stage-gates with agile iterations { data-correct }
        - Direct implementation with parallel processing

    6. Which implementation method would be most appropriate for a hospital patient records system?

        - Direct implementation for speed
        - Phased implementation by department
        - Parallel implementation for safety { data-correct }
        - Pilot implementation only

    7. What is a key benefit of using stage gates in WAgile methodology?

        - They eliminate the need for testing phases
        - They provide governance and approval checkpoints { data-correct }
        - They speed up the development process
        - They reduce the need for user training

    8. Which factor would most strongly favour choosing parallel implementation over direct implementation?

        - Limited budget for the project
        - Need for fastest possible deployment
        - Critical system that cannot afford downtime { data-correct }
        - Simple system with few integration requirements

    9. In phased implementation, what should guide the order of phase deployment?

        - Alphabetical order of system components
        - Dependencies between features and user groups { data-correct }
        - Cost of implementing each phase
        - Preference of the development team

    10. What is the main purpose of the pilot phase in implementation?

         - To train all users on the new system
         - To reduce the overall project cost
         - To identify issues in a controlled environment before full rollout { data-correct }
         - To demonstrate the system to stakeholders
