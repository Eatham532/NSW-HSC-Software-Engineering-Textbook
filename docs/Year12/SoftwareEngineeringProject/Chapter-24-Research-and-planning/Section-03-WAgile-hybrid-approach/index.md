# 24.3 WAgile hybrid approach

## Why it matters


WAgile methodology combines the structured governance of waterfall with the adaptive flexibility of agile development. This hybrid approach addresses real-world project constraints where organisations need both predictable milestones and the ability to respond to changing requirements. Understanding WAgile helps software engineers work effectively in environments that require formal approvals while maintaining development agility.

## Concepts

### Understanding the WAgile hybrid model

WAgile (Waterfall + Agile) is a hybrid methodology that structures projects using traditional waterfall stage gates while conducting development work using agile iterations within each stage.

Key characteristics of WAgile:

- **Stage gates provide governance**: Major decision points with formal approval processes

- **Agile iterations within stages**: Short development cycles that allow adaptation

- **Hybrid documentation**: Mix of upfront planning and just-in-time documentation

- **Flexible scope within constraints**: Can adapt features while meeting stage objectives

### Stage gates and governance

Stage gates are formal checkpoints where project progress is reviewed and approval is given to proceed to the next phase. They provide organisational oversight and risk management.

Typical stage gate components:

- **Deliverable review**: Assessment of completed work against criteria

- **Quality gates**: Technical and business quality standards verification

- **Resource approval**: Budget and personnel allocation for next stage

- **Risk assessment**: Evaluation of project risks and mitigation strategies

/// tab | Gate Criteria Examples
**Gate 1: Requirements Approval**

- ✓ Stakeholder needs documented and validated

- ✓ Functional and non-functional requirements defined

- ✓ Success criteria and acceptance tests specified

- ✓ Project scope and boundaries agreed

- ✓ Initial architecture and technology approach approved

**Gate 2: Design Approval**

- ✓ System architecture documented and reviewed

- ✓ User interface designs validated with stakeholders

- ✓ Data model and integration points defined

- ✓ Development approach and tooling selected

- ✓ Testing strategy and environment plan approved

**Gate 3: Implementation Approval**

- ✓ Core functionality demonstrated and tested

- ✓ Performance requirements validated

- ✓ Security review completed

- ✓ Deployment plan documented and approved

- ✓ User training materials prepared

### Iterative delivery within stages

Within each waterfall stage, agile iterations allow teams to refine work progressively and respond to feedback without compromising the overall project structure.

Benefits of iterative delivery in WAgile:

- **Progressive refinement**: Each iteration improves on previous work

- **Early feedback**: Stakeholders can see progress and provide input

- **Risk reduction**: Problems are identified and addressed quickly

- **Quality improvement**: Multiple review cycles enhance deliverable quality

/// tab | Requirements Stage Iterations
**Sprint 1: Initial Requirements Gathering**

- Stakeholder interviews and workshops

- High-level user stories and epic creation

- Initial scope definition and boundaries

**Sprint 2: Requirements Refinement**

- Detailed user story breakdown

- Acceptance criteria definition

- Non-functional requirements specification

**Sprint 3: Requirements Validation**

- Stakeholder review and feedback incorporation

- Requirements traceability matrix creation

- Final requirements document preparation

### When and how to apply WAgile interventions

WAgile interventions involve deciding when to apply waterfall structure versus agile flexibility based on project context and organisational needs.

Decision factors for WAgile interventions:

- **Regulatory requirements**: Compliance needs may require formal documentation

- **Stakeholder expectations**: Some organisations expect traditional project milestones

- **Risk tolerance**: High-risk projects may need more governance checkpoints

- **Team experience**: Less experienced teams may benefit from structured phases

/// tab | Intervention Guidelines
**Apply Waterfall Elements When**:

- Regulatory compliance requires formal documentation

- Budget approval processes need predictable milestones

- Integration with legacy systems requires detailed planning

- Stakeholders need formal progress reporting

- Risk of scope creep is high

**Apply Agile Elements When**:

- Requirements are likely to change during development

- User feedback is essential for success

- Technology choices may evolve during project

- Team needs flexibility to respond to blockers

- Innovation and experimentation are valued

**Hybrid Approaches Work Best When**:

- Organisation values both governance and agility

- Projects have mixed requirements (some stable, some evolving)

- Multiple stakeholder groups with different expectations

- Need to balance innovation with risk management

### Scale and development type considerations

WAgile methodology must be adapted based on project scale, team size, and the type of software being developed.

Scaling considerations:

- **Small teams (2-8 people)**: Lightweight stage gates, informal reviews

- **Medium teams (9-20 people)**: Structured gates, regular cross-team coordination

- **Large teams (20+ people)**: Formal gates, extensive documentation, program management

- **Enterprise scale**: Multiple projects, portfolio-level governance, standardised processes

/// tab | Scale Adaptations
**Small Team WAgile**:

- 2-3 stage gates maximum

- Sprint reviews serve as mini-gates

- Lightweight documentation focused on decisions

- Single product owner and scrum master

**Enterprise WAgile**:

- 4-6 formal stage gates with executive review

- Program-level coordination across multiple teams

- Extensive documentation for compliance and handoffs

- Multiple product owners with coordination mechanisms

**Risk Profile Adaptations**:

- **Low risk**: Fewer gates, longer iterations, informal reviews

- **Medium risk**: Standard gates, 2-week iterations, structured reviews

- **High risk**: Additional gates, shorter iterations, extensive validation

**Justification**: High risk, regulatory requirements, large distributed team needs coordination, budget scrutiny requires predictable milestones.

---

**Project C: School Website Redesign** → **Balanced WAgile**

**Recommended Structure**:

- **Stage Gates**: 2 informal gates with stakeholder review

- **Iteration Length**: 2 week sprints

- **Governance**: Weekly stakeholder demos, end-of-iteration reviews

**Stage Gates**:

1. **Design Approval Gate** (Month 2): Visual design and site structure approved by stakeholders

2. **Content Migration Gate** (Month 3): Content strategy validated, technical implementation complete

**Justification**: Small team, mixed requirements (some fixed branding, some evolving features), diverse stakeholders need regular input, fixed budget requires controlled scope.

**Common Success Factors Across All Projects**:

- **Clear gate criteria** defined upfront for all stakeholders

- **Regular iteration reviews** to collect feedback and adjust

- **Stakeholder engagement** appropriate to project scale and risk

- **Documentation level** matched to compliance and handoff needs

- **Risk management** proportional to project impact and uncertainty

## Recap

WAgile methodology provides a practical hybrid approach that combines **waterfall stage gates** for governance and risk management with **agile iterations** for flexibility and rapid feedback. The approach works best when organisations need both predictable milestones and adaptive development capability.

**Stage gates** provide formal checkpoints for approval, quality assurance, and risk assessment, while **iterative delivery within stages** allows teams to refine work progressively and respond to stakeholder feedback. The balance between waterfall and agile elements should be determined by project scale, regulatory requirements, team experience, and organisational culture.

WAgile interventions are most effective when applied thoughtfully based on specific project characteristics rather than as a one-size-fits-all approach. Success depends on clear gate criteria, appropriate governance levels, and maintaining team agility within the structured framework.
