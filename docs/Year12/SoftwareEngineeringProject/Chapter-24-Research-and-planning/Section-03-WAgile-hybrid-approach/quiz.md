# 24.3 WAgile hybrid approach - Quiz

!!! quiz "Check your understanding"

    1. What does WAgile methodology combine?

        - Waterfall planning with rapid prototyping
        - Agile ceremonies with traditional testing
        - Waterfall stage gates with agile iterations { data-correct }
        - Scrum practices with Kanban workflows

    2. What is the primary purpose of stage gates in WAgile projects?

        - To speed up development processes
        - To provide formal checkpoints for approval and risk assessment { data-correct }
        - To replace agile ceremonies entirely
        - To eliminate the need for documentation

    3. Which project characteristic would most strongly favour a waterfall-heavy WAgile approach?

        - Small team with flexible requirements
        - High regulatory compliance requirements { data-correct }
        - Rapidly changing market conditions
        - Experimental technology exploration

    4. In a WAgile project, when would you apply agile elements?

        - Only during the final testing phase
        - When requirements are likely to change and user feedback is essential { data-correct }
        - Only for small projects with limited budgets
        - When the project team lacks experience

    5. How should stage gate criteria be determined?

        - Based on development team preferences only
        - According to industry standard templates
        - Based on project risk, compliance needs, and stakeholder requirements { data-correct }
        - Using the same criteria for all projects

    6. What is the recommended approach for scaling WAgile to enterprise-level projects?

        - Use the same structure as small projects but with more people
        - Implement more formal gates, comprehensive documentation, and program-level coordination { data-correct }
        - Focus entirely on agile practices to maintain flexibility
        - Eliminate all waterfall elements to increase speed

    7. Which factor should guide the decision of when to use waterfall vs agile elements within a WAgile project?

        - The personal preferences of the project manager
        - The specific context, risk level, and stakeholder needs for each component { data-correct }
        - The budget allocated to each phase
        - The geographic location of team members

    8. What is the main benefit of iterative delivery within WAgile stages?

        - It eliminates the need for stage gate approvals
        - It allows progressive refinement and early feedback while maintaining project structure { data-correct }
        - It reduces the overall project timeline significantly
        - It removes the need for formal documentation

    9. For a small team (2-8 people) project, what WAgile structure is most appropriate?

        - 4-6 formal stage gates with extensive documentation
        - Lightweight stage gates with informal reviews { data-correct }
        - Pure agile with no waterfall elements
        - Traditional waterfall with no iterative elements

    10. What is the key to successful WAgile implementation?

         - Using more agile practices than waterfall practices
         - Applying the same hybrid approach to all project components
         - Thoughtfully balancing waterfall and agile elements based on project characteristics { data-correct }
         - Minimising stakeholder involvement to reduce complexity
