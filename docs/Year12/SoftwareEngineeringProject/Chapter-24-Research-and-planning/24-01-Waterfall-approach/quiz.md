# 24.01 Waterfall Approach - Quiz

Test your understanding of the Waterfall software development methodology.

!!! quiz "Question 1"
    What is the defining characteristic of the Waterfall methodology?

        - Iterative development with frequent releases
        - Sequential phases that must be completed before moving to the next
        - Parallel development of different system components
        - Continuous integration and deployment

!!! quiz "Question 2"
    Which phase comes immediately after Requirements Analysis in the Waterfall model?

        - Implementation
        - Testing
        - System Design
        - Deployment

    { data-correct="c" }

!!! quiz "Question 3"
    What is the primary purpose of phase gates in Waterfall methodology?

        - To speed up the development process
        - To ensure formal review and approval before proceeding to the next phase
        - To allow parallel development activities
        - To reduce documentation requirements

    { data-correct="b" }

!!! quiz "Question 4"
    Which of the following is a key artefact produced during the Requirements Analysis phase?

        - Source code documentation
        - User interface wireframes
        - Requirements Specification Document (RSD)
        - Test execution reports

    { data-correct="c" }

!!! quiz "Question 5"
    What is a major benefit of the Waterfall methodology?

        - Flexibility to change requirements at any time
        - Quick delivery of working software
        - Comprehensive documentation and clear project structure
        - Minimal planning and documentation overhead

    { data-correct="c" }

!!! quiz "Question 6"
    Which project characteristic makes Waterfall methodology MOST suitable?

        - Rapidly changing market requirements
        - Stable, well-understood requirements
        - Need for quick prototyping
        - High uncertainty about technical approach

    { data-correct="b" }

!!! quiz "Question 7"
    What is a major risk of using Waterfall methodology?

        - Too much client involvement throughout the process
        - Insufficient documentation for compliance
        - Late discovery of problems that are expensive to fix
        - Frequent changes to project scope

    { data-correct="c" }

!!! quiz "Question 8"
    Which type of organization would benefit MOST from Waterfall methodology?

        - A startup developing an innovative mobile app
        - A government agency building a compliance system
        - A small team creating a social media platform
        - A company developing experimental AI software

    { data-correct="b" }

!!! quiz "Question 9"
    What happens if a phase in Waterfall is delayed?

        - Other phases can continue in parallel
        - The delay has cascading effects on the entire project timeline
        - The project automatically switches to Agile methodology
        - Only the final delivery date is affected

    { data-correct="b" }

!!! quiz "Question 10"
    When evaluating Waterfall suitability, which factor should be considered MOST important?

        - Team size
        - Technology platform
        - Requirements stability
        - Project budget

    { data-correct="c" }
