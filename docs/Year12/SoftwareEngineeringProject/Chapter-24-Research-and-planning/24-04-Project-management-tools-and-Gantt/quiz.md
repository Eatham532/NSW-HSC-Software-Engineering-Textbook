        - To break large projects into manageable tasks { data-correct }
        - To assign team members to specific roles
        - To track project expenses

    2. In a Gantt chart, what do the horizontal bars represent?

        - Project costs over time
        - Team member availability
        - Task duration and timing { data-correct }
        - Resource utilization rates

    3. What is the critical path in project management?

        - The most expensive sequence of tasks
        - The longest sequence of dependent tasks that determines project duration { data-correct }
        - The path with the most resources assigned
        - The sequence of tasks with the highest priority

    4. Which type of task dependency means "Task B cannot start until Task A finishes"?

        - Start-to-start
        - Finish-to-finish
        - Start-to-finish
        - Finish-to-start { data-correct }

    5. What is schedule variance (SV) in project tracking?

        - The difference between planned and actual costs
        - The difference between planned and actual progress { data-correct }
        - The number of tasks completed per day
        - The percentage of team members available

    6. Which project management tool would be MOST appropriate for a small agile development team?

        - Microsoft Project with detailed Gantt charts
        - Primavera P6 for enterprise planning
        - Trello with Kanban boards { data-correct }
        - Complex spreadsheet with formulas

    7. What does project velocity measure?

        - How fast team members work
        - The rate of project completion over time { data-correct }
        - The number of bugs found per day
        - The cost per task completed

    8. Which alert type should have the HIGHEST priority in project tracking?

        - A non-critical task running slightly behind schedule
        - A critical path task experiencing significant delays { data-correct }
        - A team member being 10% over their planned hours
        - A minor quality issue in completed work

    9. When evaluating project management tools, which factor is MOST important for a distributed team?

        - Advanced reporting capabilities
        - Low cost
        - Collaboration support { data-correct }
        - Complex scheduling features

    10. What is the main benefit of using milestones in project management?

        - They reduce project costs
        - They automatically assign resources
        - They provide clear checkpoints for progress assessment { data-correct }
        - They eliminate the need for task dependencies
