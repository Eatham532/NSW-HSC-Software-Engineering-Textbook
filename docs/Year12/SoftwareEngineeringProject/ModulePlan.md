## Chapter 1 — Identifying and defining

Covers: problem framing, ideation/modelling, and implementation methods. Outcomes: SE-12-01, SE-12-06.

- Learn: define problem, constraints, scope; feasibility analysis.

- Define and analyse the requirements of a problem. Including:

  - demonstrating need(s) or opportunities (stakeholder needs, market or user research)

  - assessing scheduling and financial feasibility (time, cost estimates, resource constraints)

  - generating requirements including functionality and performance (functional and non-functional requirements)

  - defining data structures and data types required by the solution

  - defining boundaries (in-scope vs out-of-scope features and interfaces)

### 1.2 Ideation and modelling tools

- Outcomes: SE-12-06

- Learn: brainstorming, mind-maps, storyboards; data dictionaries.

- Explore tools used to develop ideas and generate solutions. Including:

  - brainstorming, mind-mapping and storyboards for idea generation

  - data dictionaries and selecting appropriate data types for fields and structures

  - algorithm design (pseudocode, flowcharts, complexity awareness)

  - code generation and prototyping (when to scaffold vs full implementation)

  - testing and debugging approaches during design (unit, integration thinking)

  - installation and maintenance considerations (packaging, deployment, update paths)

### 1.3 Implementation methods: direct, phased, parallel, pilot

- Outcomes: SE-12-06

- Learn: choose and justify an implementation method.

- Research the WAgile software development approach. Including:

  - understanding it is a hybrid model combining waterfall stage-gates with agile iterations

  - analysis of the ‘when’ and ‘how’ intervention is applied during the development life cycle (where stage gates and iterations add value)

  - considerations of scale and types of developments suitable for WAgile (small teams vs enterprise, risk profile)

Exit: students can frame a project and propose a delivery strategy.

## Chapter 2 — Research and planning

Covers: development approaches, PM tools, ethics/communication, and QA. Outcomes: SE-12-06, SE-12-05, SE-12-09.

### 2.1 Waterfall approach

- Outcomes: SE-12-06

- Learn: phases, artefacts, risks and benefits.

### 2.2 Agile approach

- Outcomes: SE-12-06

- Learn: iterations, ceremonies, user stories.

### 2.3 WAgile hybrid approach

- Outcomes: SE-12-06

- Learn: combining stage gates with iterative delivery.

### 2.4 Project management tools and Gantt

- Outcomes: SE-12-09

- Learn: planning, dependencies, tracking.

### 2.5 Social/ethical and communication issues

- Outcomes: SE-12-05

- Learn: stakeholder engagement, ethics, reporting.

- Explore communication issues associated with project work. Including:

  - involving and empowering the client (requirements workshops, demos, co-design)

  - enabling feedback (structured collection, iteration on feedback, versioning of requirements)

  - negotiating scope, priorities and acceptance criteria with stakeholders

### 2.6 Quality assurance

- Outcomes: SE-12-06

- Learn: reviews, standards, checklists, testing alignment.

- Investigate how software engineering solutions are quality assured. Including:

  - defining criteria on which quality will be judged (correctness, usability, performance, security)

  - ensuring requirements are met using a continual checking process (reviews, tests, acceptance criteria)

  - addressing compliance and legislative requirements (privacy, accessibility, industry-specific regulations)

Exit: students can plan a project and communicate it effectively.

## Chapter 3 — Producing and implementing

Covers: building, presenting, documentation, versioning, troubleshooting, prototyping/UI. Outcomes: SE-12-02, SE-12-06, SE-12-09.

### 3.1 Building the solution

- Outcomes: SE-12-02

- Learn: implement incrementally; maintain quality.

### 3.2 Presenting the solution

- Outcomes: SE-12-09

- Learn: audience, narrative, demonstrations.

### 3.3 Algorithms, documentation, and resources

- Outcomes: SE-12-06

- Learn: maintain artefacts; cite sources and libraries.

- Explain the contribution of back-end engineering to the success and ease of software development. Including:

  - technology used (web servers, databases, API frameworks, CI/CD infrastructure)

  - error handling strategies (logging, retries, graceful degradation)

  - interfacing with front-end (API contracts, authentication, data validation)

  - security engineering concerns (input validation, encryption, secure storage, secrets management)

### 3.4 Data backup and version control

- Outcomes: SE-12-06

- Learn: branching, tags, backups; release hygiene.

### 3.5 Overcoming development difficulties

- Outcomes: SE-12-06

- Learn: blockers, risk mitigation, escalation.

- Explore strategies to respond to difficulties when developing a software engineering solution. Including:

  - looking for a solution online (documentation, Q&A, authoritative sources)

  - collaboration with peers (pair programming, code reviews, mentoring)

  - outsourcing or escalation routes (engaging specialists, vendors, or external contractors)

### 3.6 Prototype and UI design

- Outcomes: SE-12-06

- Learn: wireframes, usability, accessibility.

Exit: students produce a working increment with supporting artefacts.
