# Section 26.3 Quiz: Evaluating the software solution

!!! quiz "Section 26.3 Quiz: Evaluating the software solution"

    1. What is the primary purpose of defining evaluation criteria before testing begins?
        - To limit the scope of testing activities
        - To provide objective standards for measuring solution effectiveness {data-correct}
        - To reduce the cost of the evaluation process
        - To satisfy project documentation requirements

    2. Which category of evaluation criteria focuses on whether the solution meets its intended business purpose?
        - Technical criteria
        - Functional criteria {data-correct}
        - Non-functional criteria
        - Implementation criteria

    3. When collecting evidence from stakeholder feedback, what is the most important consideration for ensuring useful results?
        - Getting feedback from as many people as possible
        - Using structured feedback collection methods aligned with evaluation criteria {data-correct}
        - Focusing only on positive feedback to build confidence
        - Collecting feedback only from technical stakeholders

    4. In the context of solution evaluation, what does "evidence synthesis" involve?
        - Combining different types of evidence to form comprehensive conclusions {data-correct}
        - Choosing the most favorable evidence to support the solution
        - Converting qualitative feedback into quantitative scores
        - Eliminating contradictory evidence from the evaluation

    5. Which approach provides the most reliable evidence for evaluating functional requirements compliance?
        - Expert opinion and code review
        - Systematic testing with clear pass/fail criteria {data-correct}
        - User satisfaction surveys
        - Performance monitoring during normal use

    6. What is the key difference between expected outputs and actual outputs in evaluation analysis?
        - Expected outputs are theoretical while actual outputs are practical
        - Expected outputs define success criteria while actual outputs show real performance {data-correct}
        - Expected outputs come from users while actual outputs come from testing
        - Expected outputs are qualitative while actual outputs are quantitative

    7. When stakeholder feedback conflicts with test results, what is the most appropriate evaluation approach?
        - Prioritize stakeholder feedback as they are the end users
        - Prioritize test results as they are more objective
        - Investigate the discrepancy to understand the underlying causes {data-correct}
        - Seek additional opinions from neutral experts

    8. Which element is essential for creating actionable recommendations in an evaluation report?
        - Detailed technical specifications
        - Specific improvement suggestions linked to identified issues {data-correct}
        - Comprehensive test execution logs
        - Stakeholder contact information for follow-up

    9. In evaluation test planning, what makes a test plan specifically focused on evaluation rather than development testing?
        - Tests are designed to collect evidence for decision-making rather than find defects {data-correct}
        - Tests focus only on positive scenarios to demonstrate success
        - Tests require less documentation and planning
        - Tests can be executed by non-technical stakeholders

    10. What is the most important outcome of the reflection phase in solution evaluation?
        - Documenting what worked well for future reference
        - Identifying specific lessons learned and areas for improvement {data-correct}
        - Creating a final project report for stakeholders
        - Validating that all requirements have been tested
