!!! quiz "Section 26.1 Quiz: Testing methodologies and optimisation"

    1. Which components are essential parts of a comprehensive test plan?
        - Test objectives and scope definition {data-correct}
        - Test approaches and methodologies {data-correct}
        - Test environments and resource requirements {data-correct}
        - Only the list of test cases to execute

    2. What is the primary purpose of functional testing?
        - To test how the system performs under load
        - To verify that the system does what it is supposed to do {data-correct}
        - To test the user interface design
        - To check system compatibility with different browsers

    3. Which type of testing focuses on verifying how different components work together?
        - Functional testing
        - Integration testing {data-correct}
        - Non-functional testing
        - Acceptance testing

    4. What is boundary value analysis used for in test data selection?
        - Testing only the middle values of input ranges
        - Testing values at the edges of input domains {data-correct}
        - Testing random values within acceptable ranges
        - Testing only invalid input values

    5. Which testing approach would be most appropriate for testing login functionality that runs with every build?
        - Manual exploratory testing
        - Automated regression testing {data-correct}
        - Manual usability testing
        - Ad-hoc testing

    6. What information should be included in a detailed test case?
        - Test case ID and objective {data-correct}
        - Prerequisites and test steps {data-correct}
        - Expected results and test data {data-correct}
        - Only the steps to execute

    7. When is manual testing most appropriate?
        - For repetitive regression tests
        - For exploratory and usability testing {data-correct}
        - For performance testing with large datasets
        - For tests that need to run frequently

    8. What is the main advantage of path testing in test data selection?
        - It tests only the happy path scenarios
        - It ensures different execution routes through code are tested {data-correct}
        - It focuses only on user interface elements
        - It eliminates the need for boundary testing

    9. Which factors should be considered when deciding between automated and manual testing?
        - Test frequency and repetition requirements {data-correct}
        - Complexity of test scenarios {data-correct}
        - Available resources and return on investment {data-correct}
        - Only the cost of automation tools

    10. What is the primary benefit of having detailed acceptance criteria in test cases?
        - They eliminate the need for test execution
        - They provide clear, measurable outcomes tied to requirements {data-correct}
        - They reduce the number of test steps needed
        - They make all tests suitable for automation
