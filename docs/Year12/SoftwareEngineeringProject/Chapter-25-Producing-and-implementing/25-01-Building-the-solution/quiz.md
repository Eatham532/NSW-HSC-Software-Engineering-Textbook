# 25.01 Building The Solution - Quiz

!!! quiz "Check your understanding of incremental implementation and quality maintenance"

    1. What is the primary benefit of incremental implementation in software development?

        - It reduces the total development time
        - It eliminates the need for testing
        - It allows for early feedback and risk reduction {data-correct}
        - It requires fewer developers

    2. When planning increments, which factor should be prioritized first?

        - Easiest features to implement
        - Features that deliver the most value to users {data-correct}
        - Features that take the longest time
        - Features that require the most complex technology

    3. What is an appropriate duration for a typical development increment?

        - 1-4 weeks {data-correct}
        - 6-8 weeks
        - 3-6 months
        - 1 year

    4. Which of the following is NOT a key component of quality maintenance during development?

        - Code reviews
        - Automated testing
        - Marketing research {data-correct}
        - Documentation updates

    5. What does continuous integration (CI) help achieve?

        - Automatic code generation
        - Early detection of integration problems {data-correct}
        - Elimination of all bugs
        - Faster internet connections

    6. In the development environment progression, what typically comes after the testing environment?

        - Development environment
        - Staging environment {data-correct}
        - Production environment
        - Research environment

    7. What is the recommended minimum test coverage target for maintaining code quality?

        - 50%
        - 65%
        - 85% {data-correct}
        - 100%

    8. Which of the following practices helps maintain consistent code quality across a development team?

        - Working in isolation
        - Using different coding styles for each developer
        - Conducting regular peer code reviews {data-correct}
        - Avoiding documentation

    9. What should happen if an increment fails to meet its acceptance criteria?

        - Move to the next increment immediately
        - The issues should be addressed before proceeding {data-correct}
        - Cancel the entire project
        - Reduce the acceptance criteria

    10. Which approach best describes test-driven development (TDD)?

        - Writing tests after all code is complete
        - Testing only the final product
        - Writing tests before implementing features {data-correct}
        - Avoiding automated testing
