        - Code documentation and testing artefacts {data-correct}
        - Marketing materials and user feedback
        - Source code files only

    2. What is the primary purpose of maintaining "living documentation"?

        - To keep documents current with code changes {data-correct}
        - To reduce the number of documents needed
        - To eliminate the need for code comments

    3. When documenting external library dependencies, which information should be included?
        - Library name and version {data-correct}
        - License type and restrictions {data-correct}
        - Purpose and functionality used {data-correct}
        - Only the installation command

    4. Which license types are typically compatible with an MIT-licensed project?
        - MIT License {data-correct}
        - BSD License {data-correct}
        - Apache License {data-correct}
        - GPL License

    5. What is a key security consideration when managing project dependencies?
        - Using only the newest versions of all libraries
        - Regularly scanning for known vulnerabilities {data-correct}
        - Avoiding all third-party libraries
        - Installing dependencies without version constraints

    6. Which of the following are typical back-end technology components?
        - Web servers (Apache, Nginx) {data-correct}
        - Databases (MySQL, MongoDB) {data-correct}
        - API frameworks (Express.js, Django) {data-correct}
        - Web browsers and mobile apps

    7. What is the primary role of an API Gateway in back-end architecture?
        - To store application data permanently
        - To route requests and manage authentication {data-correct}
        - To generate user interface components
        - To compile source code into executables

    8. Which factor is most important when selecting a database technology for a project?
        - The most popular option currently available
        - Data structure and scalability requirements {data-correct}
        - The lowest cost option
        - The technology the team used in their last project

    9. What information should be included in a comprehensive dependency security review?
        - Inventory of all direct and transitive dependencies {data-correct}
        - Vulnerability scanning results {data-correct}
        - License compatibility assessment {data-correct}
        - Only dependencies with known security issues

    10. Why is it important to understand back-end contributions to software success?
        - Back-end systems provide data management and security {data-correct}
        - They enable informed architectural decisions {data-correct}
        - Back-end is always more important than front-end
        - Understanding back-end eliminates the need for front-end knowledge
