# Year 12 â€” Software Engineering Project

This capstone module guides students through the complete software engineering lifecycle, from project conception to delivery and evaluation. Students apply all their learning to create a substantial software project, developing professional skills in project management, documentation, testing, and stakeholder communication.

## Module Overview

The Software Engineering Project is the culmination of the HSC course, where students demonstrate their ability to manage and deliver a complete software solution. This module teaches the full project lifecycle, emphasizing professional practices, documentation, and the soft skills needed for successful software development.

**Key focus areas:**

- Project identification, requirements analysis, and feasibility assessment

- Research and planning with development methodologies

- Implementation, documentation, and quality assurance

- Testing, evaluation, and project presentation

## Learning Outcomes

Students will develop the ability to:

- **Define and scope software projects** including requirements analysis and feasibility assessment (SE-12-01)

- **Apply software development methodologies** including Waterfall, Agile, and hybrid approaches (SE-12-06)

- **Implement software solutions** using appropriate technologies and development practices (SE-12-02)

- **Manage projects and stakeholders** including communication, ethics, and quality assurance (SE-12-05, SE-12-09)

- **Test and evaluate solutions** using systematic testing and evaluation methodologies (SE-12-08)

## Chapters

### Chapter 23: Identifying and Defining

Project identification, requirements gathering, feasibility analysis, ideation techniques, and selection of implementation methods (direct, phased, parallel, pilot).

### Chapter 24: Research and Planning

Development methodologies (Waterfall, Agile, WAgile hybrid), project management tools, stakeholder communication, ethical considerations, and quality assurance planning.

### Chapter 25: Producing and Implementing

Solution development, documentation practices, version control, troubleshooting strategies, UI design, and prototype development with focus on incremental delivery.

### Chapter 26: Testing and Evaluating

Testing methodologies, feedback collection and analysis, solution evaluation against requirements, and comprehensive project assessment and reflection.

## Implementation Philosophy

This module emphasizes **professional software engineering practices**:

- Complete project lifecycle from concept to delivery

- Emphasis on documentation, planning, and stakeholder management

- Integration of all technical skills learned throughout the course

- Focus on real-world project management and communication skills

- Systematic testing and quality assurance throughout development

## Prerequisites

- Completion of all Year 11 modules

- Solid Python programming skills across multiple paradigms

- Understanding of software development processes and methodologies

- Experience with version control and collaborative development

## Getting Started

1. **Begin with Chapter 23** to identify and define your project scope

2. **Progress through Chapters 24-25** to plan and implement your solution

3. **Complete with Chapter 26** to test, evaluate, and present your project

The module culminates in a substantial software engineering project that demonstrates mastery of all course concepts and professional development practices.
