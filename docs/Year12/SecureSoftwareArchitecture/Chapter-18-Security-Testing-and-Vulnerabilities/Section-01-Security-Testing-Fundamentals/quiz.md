    1. What is the primary difference between security testing and functional testing?
        - Security testing only focuses on performance
        - { data-correct } Security testing focuses on identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could be exploited
        - Security testing is only done after deployment
        - Security testing doesn't require test cases

    2. Which type of security testing involves testing without any knowledge of the system's internal structure?
        - White box testing
        - { data-correct } Black box testing
        - Gray box testing
        - Unit testing

    3. What is penetration testing primarily designed to accomplish?
        - Test system performance under load
        - { data-correct } Simulate real-world attacks to identify exploitable vulnerabilities
        - Verify functional requirements
        - Test user interface design

    4. Which security testing approach provides the most comprehensive coverage?
        - Black box testing only
        - White box testing only
        - { data-correct } Combination of black box, white box, and gray box testing
        - Automated testing only

    5. What is the purpose of vulnerability scanning in security testing?
        - To improve system performance
        - To test user acceptance
        - { data-correct } To automatically identify known security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations
        - To optimize database queries

    6. Which principle should guide the timing of security testing in the development lifecycle?
        - Only test after complete development
        - Only test during deployment
        - { data-correct } Integrate security testing throughout the entire development lifecycle
        - Only test when security incidents occur

    7. What is static application security testing (SAST) primarily used for?
        - Testing runtime behavior
        - { data-correct } Analyzing source code for security vulnerabilities without executing the program
        - Load testing applications
        - User interface testing

    8. Which type of testing is dynamic application security testing (DAST)?
        - Source code analysis
        - { data-correct } Testing running applications by simulating attacks from the outside
        - Database schema validation
        - API documentation review

    9. What is the main advantage of automated security testing tools?
        - They replace the need for security expertise
        - { data-correct } They can quickly scan for known vulnerabilities and provide consistent testing
        - They can test everything without human oversight
        - They are always more accurate than manual testing

    10. Which factor is most critical when prioritizing security test cases?
        - Development team preferences
        - Testing tool availability
        - { data-correct } Risk assessment based on potential impact and likelihood of exploitation
        - Alphabetical order of features

    11. Which of the following vulnerability types would DAST be MOST effective at detecting?
        - Hardcoded passwords in source code
        - { data-correct } SQL injection in a running web application
        - Unused import statements
        - Code complexity issues

    12. What should be the PRIMARY focus when reviewing authentication code during manual security review?
        - Code formatting and style
        - Performance optimization
        - { data-correct } Password hashing algorithms and session management
        - Variable naming conventions

    13. Which OWASP Top 10 category would include SQL injection vulnerabilities?
        - A01: Broken Access Control
        - A02: Cryptographic Failures
        - { data-correct } A03: Injection
        - A04: Insecure Design

    14. In a security testing pipeline, when should SAST tools typically be run?
        - Only in production environments
        - { data-correct } During code commit and build processes
        - After manual penetration testing
        - Only when security incidents occur

    15. What type of security testing would be MOST effective for finding Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities?
        - Static code analysis only
        - { data-correct } Dynamic testing with payload injection
        - Dependency vulnerability scanning
        - Code coverage analysis
