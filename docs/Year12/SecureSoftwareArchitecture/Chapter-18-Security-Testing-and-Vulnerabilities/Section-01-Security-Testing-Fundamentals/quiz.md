# 18.1 Security Testing Fundamentals â€” Quiz

## Question 1

What is the primary advantage of Static Application Security Testing (SAST) over Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)?

- SAST can find all possible vulnerabilities

- SAST analyzes code without executing the application

- SAST is faster than DAST

- SAST produces fewer false positives

## Question 2

Which of the following vulnerability types would DAST be MOST effective at detecting?

- Hardcoded passwords in source code

- SQL injection in a running web application

- Unused import statements

- Code complexity issues

## Question 3

In manual code review for security, what should be the PRIMARY focus when reviewing authentication code?

- Code formatting and style

- Performance optimization

- Password hashing algorithms and session management

- Variable naming conventions

## Question 4

Which OWASP Top 10 category would include SQL injection vulnerabilities?

- A01: Broken Access Control

- A02: Cryptographic Failures

- A03: Injection

- A04: Insecure Design

## Question 5

What is the main purpose of security regression testing?

- To find new vulnerabilities in the application

- To ensure that security fixes don't break existing functionality

- To test application performance under load

- To verify user interface design

## Question 6

Which of the following is a limitation of automated vulnerability scanners?

- They cannot scan large codebases

- They may produce false positives and miss context-dependent issues

- They are too expensive to implement

- They only work with specific programming languages

## Question 7

In a security testing pipeline, when should SAST tools typically be run?

- Only in production environments

- During code commit and build processes

- After manual penetration testing

- Only when security incidents occur

## Question 8

What type of security testing would be MOST effective for finding Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities?

- Static code analysis only

- Dynamic testing with payload injection

- Dependency vulnerability scanning

- Code coverage analysis

## Question 9

Which security header should be checked during DAST to prevent clickjacking attacks?

- Content-Security-Policy

- X-Frame-Options

- X-XSS-Protection

- Strict-Transport-Security

## Question 10

In a CI/CD pipeline, what should happen if critical security vulnerabilities are detected during automated testing?

- Log the issues for later review

- Continue deployment with warnings

- Fail the build and prevent deployment

- Reduce the severity rating automatically
