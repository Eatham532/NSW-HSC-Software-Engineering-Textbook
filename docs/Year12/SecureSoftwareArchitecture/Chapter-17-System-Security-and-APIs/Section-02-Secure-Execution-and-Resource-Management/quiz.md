# 17.2 Secure Execution & Resource Management â€” Quiz

## Question 1

What is the primary purpose of implementing resource limits in secure applications?

- To improve application performance

- To prevent resource exhaustion attacks (DoS)

- To reduce memory usage

- To speed up file operations

## Question 2

Which of the following is the MOST secure approach to handling file uploads?

- Accept any file type and scan for viruses afterward

- Validate filename, file size, content type, and set resource limits

- Only check file extensions

- Allow unlimited file sizes for user convenience

## Question 3

In the context of buffer overflow prevention, what is the main benefit of input validation?

- It makes the code run faster

- It prevents writing more data than a buffer can hold

- It improves user experience

- It reduces network bandwidth usage

## Question 4

What is the recommended approach for handling sensitive errors in production applications?

- Display detailed error messages to help users fix issues

- Show generic error messages to users while logging detailed errors securely

- Hide all errors completely

- Only show errors to authenticated users

## Question 5

Which timeout strategy helps prevent cascading failures in distributed systems?

- Increasing timeout values indefinitely

- Using fixed retry intervals

- Implementing circuit breaker patterns with exponential backoff

- Removing all timeouts

## Question 6

What is the primary security risk of not implementing proper memory management?

- Slower application performance

- Increased storage costs

- Buffer overflow vulnerabilities and resource exhaustion

- Reduced user satisfaction

## Question 7

In secure file operations, why is it important to validate file paths?

- To improve file access speed

- To prevent directory traversal attacks

- To organize files better

- To reduce disk space usage

## Question 8

What is the main purpose of rate limiting in secure applications?

- To make the application faster

- To prevent abuse and resource exhaustion from excessive requests

- To reduce server costs

- To improve user interface design

## Question 9

Which of the following is a secure exception handling practice?

- Displaying full stack traces to users for transparency

- Logging sensitive data in error messages

- Using generic error messages for users while logging details securely

- Ignoring all exceptions to prevent crashes

## Question 10

Why is it important to set timeouts on file operations and network requests?

- To improve application speed

- To prevent operations from hanging indefinitely and consuming resources

- To reduce memory usage

- To make debugging easier
