    - Confidentiality { data-correct }
    - Consistency
    - Compliance
    - Continuity

    **Question 2:** Which security principle ensures that data remains accurate and unmodified by unauthorized parties?

    - Confidentiality
    - Integrity { data-correct }
    - Availability
    - Authentication

    **Question 3:** In the code examples, what technique was used to protect password storage?

    - Plain text storage
    - Simple MD5 hashing
    - PBKDF2 with salt { data-correct }
    - Base64 encoding

    **Question 4:** What is the primary purpose of rate limiting in availability protection?

    - Improve system performance
    - Reduce server costs
    - Prevent resource exhaustion attacks { data-correct }
    - Enhance user experience

    **Question 5:** Which authentication factor represents "something you are"?

    - Password
    - Smart card
    - Fingerprint { data-correct }
    - Security token

    **Question 6:** In Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), what determines a user's permissions?

    - User's IP address
    - Time of access
    - User's assigned role { data-correct }
    - System load

    **Question 7:** What is the main purpose of accountability in security?

    - Prevent unauthorized access
    - Encrypt sensitive data
    - Track and audit user actions { data-correct }
    - Improve system performance

    **Question 8:** In the authentication example, what happens after multiple failed login attempts?

    - Password is reset automatically
    - User account is deleted
    - Account is temporarily locked { data-correct }
    - System shuts down

    **Question 9:** Which component ensures non-repudiation in the accountability system?

    - Password complexity requirements
    - Role-based permissions
    - Audit logging with integrity protection { data-correct }

    **Question 10:** What does the circuit breaker pattern help protect against?

    - SQL injection attacks
    - Password brute force
    - Cascading system failures { data-correct }
    - Data encryption failures

    **Question 11:** In the authorization example, why might a student be denied access to another student's grades?

    - System maintenance
    - Network connectivity issues
    - Resource ownership restrictions { data-correct }
    - Database corruption

    **Question 12:** What makes the audit logging system tamper-evident?

    - File permissions
    - Database encryption
    - Integrity hashes for each log entry { data-correct }
    - User authentication

    - Confidentiality { data-correct }
    - Integrity
    - Availability
    - Authorization

    **Question 14:** In the library system example, what additional security measure is required for administrators?

    - Stronger passwords
    - IP address restrictions
    - Multi-factor authentication { data-correct }
    - Biometric scanning

    **Question 15:** What is the primary benefit of implementing all six security principles together?

    - Reduced implementation costs
