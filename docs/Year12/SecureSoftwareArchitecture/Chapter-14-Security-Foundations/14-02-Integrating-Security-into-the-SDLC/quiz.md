# 14.02 Integrating Security Into The Sdlc - Quiz

!!! quiz "Check your understanding"

    **Question 1:** According to the section, how much more expensive is it to fix security issues in production versus during the design phase?

    - 10x more expensive
    - 30x more expensive
    - 63x more expensive { data-correct }
    - 100x more expensive

    **Question 2:** Which SDLC phase should include "threat modeling initiation" as a security activity?

    - Requirements & Planning { data-correct }
    - Design & Architecture
    - Implementation & Development
    - Testing & Validation

    **Question 3:** In the STRIDE framework, what does the "T" represent?

    - Trust boundary violations
    - Tampering with data { data-correct }
    - Transaction manipulation
    - Timeout vulnerabilities

    **Question 4:** Which security activity is most appropriate during the Implementation & Development phase?

    - Penetration testing
    - Trust boundary identification
    - Static analysis scanning { data-correct }
    - Security monitoring setup

    **Question 5:** What is the primary benefit of integrating security early in the SDLC rather than adding it later?

    - It eliminates all security vulnerabilities
    - It requires fewer security professionals
    - It's significantly less expensive and more effective { data-correct }
    - It automatically meets all compliance requirements

    **Question 6:** In the e-learning platform example, which security control was selected to prevent abuse of the API?

    - Multi-factor authentication
    - Database encryption
    - API rate limiting { data-correct }
    - Comprehensive audit logging

    **Question 7:** What type of security testing simulates real-world attacks against a running application?

    - Static analysis
    - Security unit testing
    - Penetration testing { data-correct }
    - Code security reviews

    **Question 8:** Which STRIDE threat category involves an attacker pretending to be someone else?

    - Spoofing identity { data-correct }
    - Tampering with data
    - Repudiation
    - Elevation of privilege

    **Question 9:** In the secure coding example, what technique was used to prevent SQL injection in the `get_student_grades` function?

    - Input sanitization only
    - Stored procedures
    - Parameterized queries { data-correct }
    - Database encryption

    **Question 10:** During which phase should "security monitoring setup" be implemented?

    - Requirements & Planning
    - Design & Architecture
    - Implementation & Development
    - Deployment & Maintenance { data-correct }

    **Question 11:** What is a "trust boundary" in security architecture?

    - The limit of user trust in the application
    - Where data crosses between security zones { data-correct }
    - The maximum number of trusted users
    - The boundary of the development team's security knowledge

    **Question 12:** In the threat modeling exercise solution, which threat was ranked as the highest priority?

    - Student accessing other students' quizzes
    - SQL injection in quiz submission { data-correct }
    - Weak authentication allowing account takeover
    - DoS attacks during exam periods
