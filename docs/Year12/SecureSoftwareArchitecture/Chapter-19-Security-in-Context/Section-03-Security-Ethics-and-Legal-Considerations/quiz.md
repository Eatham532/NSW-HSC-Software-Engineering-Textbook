A) 30% for IT Support
B) 45% for Software Development
C) 55% for Compliance
D) 65% for Security Specialists

**Answer**: D) 65% for Security Specialists

**Explanation**: Security specialists have the largest skills gap at 65%, meaning 65% of positions are hard to fill due to lack of qualified candidates.

## Question 12

According to the IP compliance framework, which license combination is generally incompatible?

A) MIT + Apache 2.0
B) BSD + MIT
C) GPL v3 + Proprietary
D) Apache 2.0 + MIT

**Answer**: C) GPL v3 + Proprietary

**Explanation**: GPL v3 requires source code disclosure, making it incompatible with proprietary software that cannot disclose source code.
