# Year 12 — Programming for the Web

This module explores modern web development through full-stack Python applications, teaching students how to build secure, accessible, and scalable web systems. From client-server architecture to database design, it covers the complete web development lifecycle with emphasis on standards, security, and user experience.

## Module Overview

Web programming powers much of modern software, from simple websites to complex enterprise systems. This module teaches both front-end and back-end development using Python, with a focus on security, accessibility, and scalable architectures that prepare students for real-world web development.

**Key focus areas:**

- Web protocols, security, and data transmission fundamentals

- Standards-compliant and accessible web design

- Full-stack Python development with databases

- Progressive Web Apps and modern web architectures

## Learning Outcomes

Students will develop the ability to:

- **Understand web technologies** including protocols, data transmission, and security concepts (SE-12-03, SE-12-04)

- **Design web applications** using client-server models, databases, and scalable architectures (SE-12-02)

- **Apply web standards** including accessibility, security, and best practices (SE-12-06)

## Chapters

### Chapter 11: Web Foundations and Data Transmission

Web applications and data movement on the internet, covering protocols (HTTP/HTTPS, TCP/IP, DNS), ports, SSL/TLS encryption, certificates, authentication, and large-scale web architectures for handling big data.

### Chapter 12: Designing Web Applications

Web standards and accessibility, client-server architecture, developer tools, CSS and UI/UX principles, front-end libraries and frameworks, and content management systems with evaluation of open-source development models.

### Chapter 13: Back-end Databases and PWAs

Server-side Python development, database design (SQL and NoSQL), ORM patterns, performance optimization, and Progressive Web App implementation with offline capabilities and service workers.

## Implementation Philosophy

This module emphasizes **standards-first web development**:

- Python-only approach for consistency across full-stack development

- Security and accessibility integrated throughout all topics

- Progressive enhancement from simple websites to complex applications

- Emphasis on web standards and best practices

- Real-world considerations for scalability and performance

## Prerequisites

- Solid Python programming skills (functions, classes, data structures)

- Basic understanding of HTML/CSS concepts (helpful but taught)

- Familiarity with software development processes

## Getting Started

1. **Begin with Chapter 11** to understand web protocols and security foundations

2. **Progress through Chapter 12** to learn web design and front-end development

3. **Complete with Chapter 13** to implement back-end systems and databases

The module builds comprehensive web development skills from network fundamentals to full-stack applications.
