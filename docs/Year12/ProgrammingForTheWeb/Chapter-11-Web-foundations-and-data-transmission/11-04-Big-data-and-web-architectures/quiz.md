!!! quiz "Check your understanding"

    1. What is the main purpose of data mining in web applications?

        - To reduce server costs
        - To find patterns and insights in large datasets { data-correct }
        - To compress data for storage
        - To encrypt sensitive information

    2. Which of the following is an example of metadata?

        - The actual content of an article
        - User comments on a blog post
        - Tags, author, and creation date of a document { data-correct }
        - Server error logs

    3. What is a key challenge when processing streaming data?

        - Data arrives continuously and must be processed in real-time { data-correct }
        - Data is always encrypted
        - Data files are too large to store
        - Data only arrives once per day

    4. Which architecture pattern involves a single deployable unit containing all functionality?

        - Microservices
        - Serverless
        - Monolithic { data-correct }
        - Distributed

    5. What is a main advantage of microservices architecture?

        - Simpler deployment process
        - No network latency between components
        - Independent scaling of individual services { data-correct }
        - Single technology stack for everything

    6. When might serverless architecture be the best choice?

        - For applications with constant, predictable load
        - For applications requiring very long processing times
        - For applications with variable or unpredictable load { data-correct }
        - For applications that need direct server access

    7. Which of the following would cause dropped messages in a streaming system?

        - Network connectivity issues
        - Buffer overflow when data arrives faster than it can be processed { data-correct }
        - Incorrect data formatting
        - Server restart

    8. What type of insights can web analytics data mining typically provide?

        - User behavior patterns and conversion rates { data-correct }
        - Server hardware specifications
        - Database schema designs
        - Network routing protocols

    9. In the context of big data, what does "metadata" help with?

        - Increasing data storage capacity
        - Making data easier to find, understand, and organize { data-correct }
        - Encrypting sensitive information
        - Reducing network bandwidth usage

    10. Which architecture pattern typically has the lowest operational overhead for small teams?

        - Microservices with container orchestration
        - Serverless with managed services { data-correct }
        - Monolithic with manual deployment
        - Hybrid multi-cloud setup
