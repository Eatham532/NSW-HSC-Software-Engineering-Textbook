!!! quiz "Check your understanding"

    1. What is the primary purpose of front-end frameworks in complex web applications?

        - To make websites look better
        - To provide structured approaches for routing, state management, and component organization { data-correct }
        - To reduce the amount of HTML needed
        - To make websites load faster

    2. Which of the following is a key benefit of template engines in server-side rendering?

        - They eliminate the need for CSS
        - They allow dynamic HTML generation using back-end data { data-correct }
        - They automatically optimize images
        - They handle user authentication

    3. What is the main advantage of using a component library?

        - It reduces server load
        - It provides pre-designed, reusable UI elements for consistency and faster development { data-correct }
        - It eliminates the need for JavaScript
        - It automatically handles responsive design

    4. When would you choose to build bespoke code instead of using a library?

        - When you have a tight timeline
        - When you need unique requirements and full control over implementation { data-correct }
        - When your team lacks experience
        - When you want faster development

    5. What does "state management" mean in the context of front-end frameworks?

        - Managing the visual appearance of components
        - Controlling and synchronizing data across different parts of an application { data-correct }
        - Handling server requests
        - Managing user permissions

    6. Which factor would most strongly favor using an existing library over building custom code?

        - Need for unique features
        - Performance-critical requirements
        - Tight development timeline { data-correct }
        - Small team size

    7. What is a utility-first CSS approach?

        - Writing CSS from scratch for each component
        - Using small, single-purpose classes that can be combined { data-correct }
        - Only using CSS for utilities like margins and padding
        - Avoiding CSS frameworks entirely

    8. What should you consider when evaluating whether to adopt a front-end framework?

        - Only the size of the framework file
        - Project complexity, team experience, timeline, and maintenance requirements { data-correct }
        - Just the popularity of the framework
        - Only the visual design capabilities

    9. What is the purpose of routing in single-page applications (SPAs)?

        - To optimize network requests
        - To navigate between different views without full page reloads { data-correct }
        - To manage server-side logic
        - To handle user authentication

    10. Which approach would be best for a simple informational website with minimal interactivity?

        - Complex JavaScript framework with state management
        - Minimal custom code with progressive enhancement { data-correct }
        - Heavy component library with extensive features
        - Server-side rendering framework
