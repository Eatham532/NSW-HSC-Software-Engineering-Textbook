!!! quiz "Check your understanding"

    1. Which of the following is primarily a client-side responsibility in a web application?

        - Processing database queries
        - User interface rendering and interaction { data-correct }
        - User authentication validation
        - File system access

    2. What is the main advantage of using SQL databases over NoSQL databases?

        - They always perform faster
        - They provide ACID properties and structured relationships { data-correct }
        - They require no setup or configuration
        - They automatically scale horizontally

    3. Which component sits between different parts of a web system to handle cross-cutting concerns?

        - Database
        - Middleware { data-correct }
        - Client browser
        - HTML templates

    4. In a typical web request flow, what happens first?

        - The database is queried
        - The server processes business logic
        - The client sends an HTTP request { data-correct }
        - Middleware validates the response

    5. Which of the following is an example of a third-party API integration?

        - User login form validation
        - Processing payment transactions with Stripe { data-correct }
        - Rendering HTML templates
        - Storing user data in a local database

    6. When would you choose a NoSQL database over a SQL database?

        - When you need ACID compliance
        - When you have complex relationships between data
        - When you need flexible schemas and rapid scaling { data-correct }
        - When you want to use standard SQL queries

    7. What does "progressive enhancement" mean in client-side web development?

        - Gradually improving server performance
        - Building experiences that work across different browser capabilities { data-correct }
        - Incrementally adding more databases
        - Slowly migrating from HTTP to HTTPS

    8. Which HTTP method would typically be used to retrieve user information from a REST API?

        - POST
        - PUT
        - GET { data-correct }
        - DELETE

    9. What is the primary purpose of routing in server-side web programming?

        - To encrypt data transmission
        - To direct requests to appropriate code handlers { data-correct }
        - To compress response data
        - To validate user input

    10. In the context of web development, what does API stand for?

        - Advanced Programming Interface
        - Application Programming Interface { data-correct }
        - Automated Process Integration
        - Application Performance Indicator
