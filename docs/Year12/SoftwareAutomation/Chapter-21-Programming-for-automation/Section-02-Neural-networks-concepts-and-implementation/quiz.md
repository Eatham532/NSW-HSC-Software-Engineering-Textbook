    11. **Short Answer (5 marks)**: Explain the basic structure of a feedforward neural network. Describe how information flows from input to output and what happens at each layer.

        *Expected answer should cover: Input layer receives data, hidden layers process information through weighted connections and activation functions, output layer produces final result. Information flows forward only, each neuron computes weighted sum of inputs plus bias, applies activation function.*

    12. **Short Answer (5 marks)**: What are the key differences between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)? Give an example use case for each.

        *Expected answer should cover: CNNs use convolution operations for spatial data like images, good for pattern recognition. RNNs have memory/feedback connections for sequential data like text or time series. CNN example: image classification. RNN example: language translation or stock prediction.*

    13. **Short Answer (5 marks)**: A company wants to implement a neural network to automate quality control in manufacturing by analyzing product images. What type of neural network would you recommend, and what are the key implementation considerations?

        *Expected answer should cover: Recommend CNN for image analysis, considerations include image preprocessing, sufficient labeled training data, data augmentation, transfer learning from pre-trained models, integration with manufacturing systems, real-time performance requirements.*

    14. **Short Answer (10 marks)**: Describe the process of training a neural network from start to finish. Include the key steps, what happens during training, and how you would evaluate the model's performance.

        *Expected answer should cover: Data preparation and splitting, network architecture design, weight initialization, forward pass computation, loss calculation, backpropagation for weight updates, iterative training over epochs, validation monitoring, performance evaluation with test data, metrics like accuracy or loss.*

    15. **Short Answer (10 marks)**: A healthcare organization wants to use neural networks to analyze medical images for diagnostic assistance. Discuss the technical implementation challenges, ethical considerations, and practical requirements they should address. How would this differ from typical automation projects?

        *Expected answer should cover: Technical challenges include high accuracy requirements, large annotated datasets, model interpretability, regulatory compliance. Ethical considerations include patient privacy, bias in training data, decision transparency, human oversight. Practical requirements include integration with medical workflows, continuous learning, regulatory approval processes. Different from typical automation due to life-critical decisions, strict regulations, need for medical expert validation.*
