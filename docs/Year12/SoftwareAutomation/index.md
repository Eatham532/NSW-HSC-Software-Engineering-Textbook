# Year 12 â€” Software Automation

This module builds intuition for machine learning and automation through simple, reproducible Python examples, with a focus on from-scratch implementations to develop deep understanding of core algorithms and concepts.

## Module Overview

Software automation represents the intersection of programming skills and intelligent systems. This module covers machine learning fundamentals, core algorithms, and their applications in automated systems, emphasizing both theoretical understanding and practical implementation.

## Learning Outcomes

Students will develop the ability to:

- **Distinguish** between AI, ML, and automation approaches (RPA/BPA)

- **Build and trace** simple models conceptually and in code

- **Implement** core regression algorithms and neural networks from scratch

- **Assess** the impact of automation on individuals, society, and environment

- **Evaluate** bias and ethical considerations in ML/AI systems

## Chapters

### [Chapter 20: ML and Automation Basics](Chapter-20-ML-and-automation-basics/)

Introduction to machine learning fundamentals, definitions, applications, and simple model design. Covers the distinction between AI and ML, training processes, common applications, and practical implementation of decision trees and neural networks.

### [Chapter 21: Programming for Automation](Chapter-21-Programming-for-automation/)

Hands-on implementation of core machine learning algorithms including regression models (linear, logistic, polynomial, K-nearest neighbors) and neural networks, with emphasis on mathematical foundations and practical coding skills.

### [Chapter 22: Significance and Impact](Chapter-22-Significance-and-impact/)

Assessment of automation's impact on society, human behavior patterns, and bias in ML systems. Explores safety, accessibility, employment effects, and ethical considerations in automated system development.

## Implementation Philosophy

This module emphasizes **practical understanding through implementation**:

- From-scratch Python implementations to build algorithmic intuition

- Real-world examples demonstrating automation applications

- Mathematical foundations explained through working code

- Comprehensive evaluation and validation techniques

- Ethical considerations integrated throughout technical content

## Prerequisites

- Solid Python programming skills

- Basic mathematical concepts (algebra, statistics)

- Understanding of data structures and algorithms

- Familiarity with problem-solving methodologies

## Getting Started

1. **Read the [Module Plan](ModulePlan.md)** for detailed scope and learning objectives

2. **Begin with Chapter 20** to establish ML and automation foundations

3. **Progress through Chapter 21** for hands-on algorithm implementation

4. **Complete with Chapter 22** to understand broader implications and ethical considerations

The module is designed for sequential progression, with each chapter building upon previous concepts while introducing new practical applications and implementation challenges.
