    1. What is the most important factor to consider before implementing RPA in an organization?
        - The cost of RPA software licenses
        - { data-correct } Process stability and standardization
        - The number of employees who will use the system
        - The speed of the organization's computers

    2. Which characteristic makes a process ideal for RPA automation?
        - High complexity requiring human judgment
        - { data-correct } High volume, repetitive, and rule-based
        - Frequent changes and exceptions
        - Requires creative problem-solving

    3. What is a key limitation of RPA that organizations should understand?
        - RPA cannot work with cloud-based applications
        - { data-correct } RPA is fragile and breaks when application interfaces change
        - RPA only works during business hours
        - RPA requires dedicated servers to run

    4. In BPA implementation, what should be the first step in the process?
        - Purchase the automation software
        - { data-correct } Map and analyze the current process
        - Train employees on new procedures
        - Implement the technical solution

    5. What is the primary risk of automating a poorly designed business process?
        - The automation will run too slowly
        - { data-correct } You will automate inefficiency and amplify existing problems
        - The automation will cost more than expected
        - The automation will require more maintenance

    6. Which factor is most critical for long-term RPA success?
        - Using the most advanced RPA platform available
        - { data-correct } Having dedicated maintenance and monitoring procedures
        - Automating as many processes as possible quickly
        - Training all employees to build their own bots

    7. What is "exception handling" in the context of RPA?
        - Preventing RPA bots from making errors
        - { data-correct } Defining what the bot should do when unexpected situations occur
        - Removing all exceptions from business processes
        - Creating backup bots for redundancy

    8. In BPA projects, why is stakeholder involvement crucial throughout the process?
        - To reduce the cost of the project
        - { data-correct } To ensure the solution meets actual business needs and gains adoption
        - To speed up the implementation timeline
        - To avoid purchasing unnecessary software

    9. What is the recommended approach for scaling RPA across an organization?
        - Automate all processes simultaneously for maximum impact
        - { data-correct } Start with pilot projects and gradually expand based on lessons learned
        - Focus only on the most complex processes first
        - Wait until all processes are perfectly standardized

    10. Which metric is most important for measuring RPA success?
        - Number of bots deployed
        - { data-correct } Business value delivered and process improvement achieved
        - Technical uptime percentage
        - Speed of bot execution

    11. **Short Answer (5 marks)**: A company wants to implement RPA for their invoice processing. Currently, different departments handle invoices differently, and there are frequent changes to vendor formats. What advice would you give them before starting their RPA project?

        *Expected answer should cover: Need to standardize invoice processing procedures first, document current variations, establish standard vendor formats or data extraction methods, create exception handling procedures, consider ML-enhanced solutions for format variations, ensure process stability before automation.*

    12. **Short Answer (5 marks)**: Explain the concept of "digital workforce" in RPA implementations. What are the key considerations for managing and maintaining software bots as if they were employees?

        *Expected answer should cover: Bots as digital employees concept, need for scheduling and resource allocation, monitoring bot performance and errors, version control and updates, security access management, documentation and knowledge transfer, scalability planning, lifecycle management.*

    13. **Short Answer (5 marks)**: A manufacturing company is considering BPA for their order-to-delivery process, which currently involves 15 different systems and 8 departments. What practical challenges should they expect, and how might they address them?

        *Expected answer should cover: System integration complexity, data consistency across systems, change management across departments, stakeholder alignment, technical compatibility issues, phased implementation approach, process standardization needs, training requirements.*

    14. **Short Answer (5 marks)**: Compare the maintenance requirements of RPA versus BPA solutions. Why might one require more ongoing attention than the other?

        *Expected answer should cover: RPA requires frequent maintenance due to UI changes, application updates, data format variations. BPA requires less frequent but more significant updates when business processes change. RPA is more fragile to external changes, BPA is more resilient but requires broader organizational change management.*

    15. **Short Answer (5 marks)**: An organization implemented RPA for data entry but found that 30% of their bots fail daily due to exceptions. What practical steps should they take to improve the reliability and efficiency of their automation?

        *Expected answer should cover: Analyze failure patterns, improve exception handling logic, implement robust error logging, create manual fallback procedures, consider ML enhancement for variable data handling, establish monitoring and alerting systems, review process standardization, implement proper testing procedures.*
