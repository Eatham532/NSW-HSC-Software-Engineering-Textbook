d) Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior

    11. **Short Answer (5 marks)**: Explain the difference between training data, validation data, and test data. Why is it important to keep these datasets separate?</div>



        *Expected answer should cover: Training data teaches the model patterns, validation data helps tune parameters and prevent overfitting during development, test data provides final unbiased evaluation. Separation prevents data leakage and ensures honest performance assessment.*<div class="explanation">

**Correct Answer: D**

    12. **Short Answer (5 marks)**: A company wants to build a model to predict customer churn (customers leaving the service). They have 5 years of customer data including demographics, usage patterns, and whether customers eventually left. Describe how they should split this data and what they should be careful about.

Customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior is ideal for unsupervised learning because you don't know the customer groups ahead of time - you want to discover them from the data. Clustering algorithms can find natural groupings of similar customers without predefined labels.

        *Expected answer should cover: Chronological splitting (older data for training, recent for testing), ensuring no data leakage from future to past, balancing the dataset if churn is rare, considering seasonal patterns, maintaining representative samples across all splits.*</div>



    13. **Short Answer (5 marks)**: What are three common signs that a machine learning model might be overfitting, and what strategies could you use to address each one?---

## Question 12: Medical Imaging Scenario

**A hospital has 10,000 medical scans. Experts have labeled 200 as "abnormal" and 300 as "normal," but 9,500 scans remain unlabeled. What's the best ML approach?**

<div class="quiz-question" data-answer="c">
a) Use only supervised learning with the 500 labeled scans
b) Use only unsupervised learning to find patterns in all 10,000 scans
c) Use semi-supervised learning to leverage both labeled and unlabeled scans
d) Use reinforcement learning to learn from radiologist feedback
</div>

<div class="explanation">
**Correct Answer: C**

This is a classic semi-supervised learning scenario: you have a small amount of expensive expert-labeled data (500 scans) and a large amount of unlabeled data (9,500 scans). Semi-supervised learning can use both to build a better model than either approach alone.
</div>

## Question 15: Paradigm Combination Strategy

**A company wants to automate customer service. They have some labeled examples of good/bad responses, lots of unlabeled customer messages, and the ability to get feedback on response quality. What's the best overall strategy?**

<div class="quiz-question" data-answer="d">
a) Use only supervised learning with the labeled examples
b) Use only reinforcement learning with quality feedback
c) Use only unsupervised learning to find message patterns
d) Combine multiple paradigms: semi-supervised for classification, reinforcement for response optimization
</div>

<div class="explanation">
**Correct Answer: D**

This complex scenario benefits from multiple paradigms: semi-supervised learning can leverage both labeled examples and unlabeled messages to classify customer inquiries, while reinforcement learning can optimize response strategies based on customer satisfaction feedback. Real-world systems often benefit from combining approaches.
</div>

## Question 16: Data Quality Considerations

**Which statement about data requirements is most accurate across all ML paradigms?**

<div class="quiz-question" data-answer="b">
a) More data always leads to better performance regardless of quality
b) Clean, representative data is more valuable than large, messy datasets
c) Supervised learning always requires more data than other paradigms
d) Unlabeled data is never useful for improving model performance
</div>

<div class="explanation">
**Correct Answer: B**

Across all ML paradigms, data quality is crucial. Clean, representative data that accurately reflects the real-world problem is more valuable than large amounts of noisy, biased, or unrepresentative data. Quality should be prioritized over quantity in data collection and preparation.
</div>

b) Only precision and recall
c) Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
d) Only the confusion matrix
</div>

<div class="explanation">
**Correct Answer: C**

A comprehensive evaluation of a classification system requires multiple metrics: accuracy (overall correctness), precision (how many predicted spam emails are actually spam), recall (how many actual spam emails are caught), and F1-score (harmonic mean balancing precision and recall). Each metric reveals different aspects of performance.
</div>

---

## Question 18: Learning Curve Analysis

**In reinforcement learning, what does an improving learning curve (increasing average reward over episodes) indicate?**

<div class="quiz-question" data-answer="a">
a) The agent is successfully learning better policies through experience
b) The environment is becoming easier over time
c) The reward function is broken and needs adjustment
d) The agent is overfitting to the training environment
</div>

<div class="explanation">
**Correct Answer: A**

An improving learning curve in reinforcement learning shows that the agent is successfully learning better policies through trial and error. As it gains more experience, it makes better decisions that lead to higher cumulative rewards, demonstrating effective learning.
</div>

---

## Question 19: Practical Implementation Challenge

**What is the biggest practical challenge when implementing semi-supervised learning?**

<div class="quiz-question" data-answer="b">
a) It requires more computational power than other approaches
