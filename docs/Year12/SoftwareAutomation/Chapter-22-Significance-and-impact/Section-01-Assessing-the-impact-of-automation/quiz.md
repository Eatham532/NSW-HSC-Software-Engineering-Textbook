    2. How can automation improve accessibility for people with disabilities?
        - By eliminating all human interaction
        - { data-correct } By providing alternative interfaces and reducing physical barriers
        - By making everything faster
        - By reducing costs for everyone

    3. What is the most significant challenge automation poses for employment?
        - Increased working hours
        - { data-correct } Displacement of workers in routine and predictable jobs
        - Higher wages for all workers
        - Reduced workplace safety

    4. Which environmental impact is most commonly associated with increased automation?
        - Reduced air pollution from factories
        - { data-correct } Higher energy consumption from computing and robotics
        - Elimination of all industrial waste
        - Improved water quality

    5. What is "reskilling" in the context of automation?
        - Replacing all human workers with machines
        - { data-correct } Training workers for new roles as automation changes job requirements
        - Reducing the skill level required for jobs
        - Eliminating job training programs

    6. How does automation typically affect production efficiency?
        - It always decreases efficiency due to complexity
        - { data-correct } It generally increases efficiency by reducing errors and downtime
        - It has no measurable impact on efficiency
        - It only improves efficiency in small businesses

    7. What is a potential negative impact of automation on wealth distribution?
        - It always creates more jobs than it eliminates
        - { data-correct } It may concentrate wealth among those who own automated systems
        - It guarantees equal income for all workers
        - It eliminates the need for economic policy

    8. Which workplace safety consideration is most important when introducing automation?
        - Ensuring robots work faster than humans
        - { data-correct } Proper training for human-machine interaction and emergency procedures
        - Removing all safety equipment
        - Maximizing the speed of automated processes

    9. How can automation impact people with disabilities in the workplace?
        - It always eliminates jobs for people with disabilities
        - { data-correct } It can create new opportunities while potentially eliminating others
        - It has no effect on accessibility
        - It only benefits people without disabilities

    10. What is the primary environmental concern with widespread AI and automation deployment?
        - Reduced manufacturing output
        - { data-correct } Increased carbon footprint from data centers and computing infrastructure
        - Elimination of all environmental benefits
        - Reduced demand for renewable energy

    11. **Short Answer (5 marks)**: Explain how automation can both create and eliminate jobs. Provide specific examples of each and discuss what factors determine the net impact on employment.

        *Expected answer should cover: Automation eliminates routine/predictable jobs (manufacturing assembly, data entry) but creates new jobs (robot maintenance, AI specialists, automation engineers). Net impact depends on speed of change, retraining availability, economic sector, and policy responses. Economic factors include productivity gains and demand for new services.*

    12. **Short Answer (5 marks)**: A manufacturing company is considering full automation of their assembly line. Analyze the potential impacts on worker safety, both positive and negative, and recommend strategies to maximize safety benefits.

        *Expected answer should cover: Positive impacts include removing workers from repetitive strain, dangerous machinery, hazardous materials. Negative impacts include new risks from robot interaction, system failures, reduced human oversight. Strategies include proper safety training, emergency stop systems, human-robot collaboration protocols, regular maintenance, and maintaining human supervision roles.*

    13. **Short Answer (5 marks)**: Discuss how automation might affect wealth inequality in society. Consider both the mechanisms that could worsen inequality and potential policy responses that could mitigate these effects.

        *Expected answer should cover: Worsening factors include capital owners benefiting more than workers, skill-biased technological change favoring high-skilled workers, job displacement in middle-income roles. Mitigation strategies include progressive taxation, universal basic income, public investment in retraining, ensuring broad access to automation benefits, antitrust enforcement.*

    14. **Short Answer (10 marks)**: A city is planning to implement automated systems across multiple services (traffic management, waste collection, public transportation). Analyze the potential environmental impacts, both positive and negative, and recommend an approach to maximize environmental benefits while minimizing harm.

        *Expected answer should cover: Positive impacts include optimized traffic flow reducing emissions, efficient waste routing, improved public transport utilization. Negative impacts include energy consumption of computing systems, electronic waste from sensors/devices, potential for increased urban sprawl if transport becomes too efficient. Recommendations include renewable energy for computing, circular economy principles for hardware, integrated planning to prevent unintended consequences, lifecycle assessment of all systems.*

    15. **Short Answer (5 marks)**: Describe three specific ways that automation technologies could be designed to be more inclusive for people with disabilities. Explain how each design choice could create opportunities rather than barriers.

        *Expected answer should cover: Voice/gesture interfaces for those with mobility limitations, visual/audio alternatives for sensory impairments, customizable interaction methods, predictable and consistent interfaces, integration with assistive technologies. Opportunities include remote work capabilities, reduced physical demands, personalized assistance, and new roles in accessibility testing and design.*
