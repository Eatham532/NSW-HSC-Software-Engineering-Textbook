    ---

    1. How do psychological responses typically affect user acceptance of automated decision-making systems?
        - Users always prefer automated decisions for consistency
        - { data-correct } Users often resist systems they cannot understand or control
        - Psychological factors have no impact on system adoption
        - Users prefer complex AI systems over simple rule-based ones

    2. What is the most significant way that acute stress response patterns can affect ML model performance?
        - Stress makes users input data faster
        - { data-correct } Stress changes user behavior patterns, making training data less representative
        - Stress has no measurable impact on data quality
        - Stress only affects the developers, not the end users

    3. Which cultural factor is most important to consider when deploying ML systems internationally?
        - The local internet connection speed
        - { data-correct } Local norms around privacy, authority, and decision-making
        - The availability of technical support
        - The cost of computing hardware

    4. How do belief systems influence user interaction with AI interfaces?
        - They determine the programming language used
        - { data-correct } They shape expectations about system capabilities and trustworthiness
        - They only matter for religious applications
        - They affect hardware requirements

    5. What is "automation bias" in the context of human-AI interaction?
        - The tendency for AI systems to favor automated solutions
        - { data-correct } The human tendency to over-rely on automated recommendations
        - A programming error that favors certain outcomes
        - The preference for manual processes over automation

    6. Which design approach best addresses cultural sensitivity in ML applications?
        - Using the same interface globally for consistency
        - { data-correct } Adapting interfaces and workflows to local cultural expectations
        - Only deploying in technologically advanced countries
        - Requiring cultural training for all users

    7. How can acute stress affect the quality of data collected for ML training?
        - Stress improves focus and data accuracy
        - { data-correct } Stress leads to more errors, inconsistencies, and atypical patterns
        - Stress has no impact on data collection
        - Stress only affects numerical data, not text or images

    8. What is the primary psychological barrier to AI adoption in decision-critical domains like healthcare?
        - Fear of job replacement
        - { data-correct } Lack of transparency and explainability in AI decisions
        - Cost concerns
        - Technical complexity

    9. Which cultural protocol consideration is most critical for ML systems handling personal data?
        - User interface language translation
        - { data-correct } Local privacy expectations and data sovereignty requirements
        - Time zone differences
        - Currency conversion

    10. How do different cultural attitudes toward authority affect AI system design?
        - They determine the processing speed requirements
        - { data-correct } They influence whether users prefer systems that explain or simply direct
        - They only matter for government applications
        - They affect the choice of programming framework

    11. **Short Answer (5 marks)**: Explain how the "uncanny valley" effect applies to AI interfaces and how it might influence user acceptance. Provide an example of how developers could address this in their design.

        *Expected answer should cover: Uncanny valley describes discomfort when AI seems almost but not quite human. Users may feel unsettled by chatbots or virtual assistants that are too human-like but clearly artificial. Solutions include making AI clearly artificial (no attempt to seem human) or ensuring very high quality human-like interaction.*

    12. **Short Answer (5 marks)**: A company wants to deploy an ML-powered recruitment system globally. Describe three cultural considerations they should address and how these might affect the system's design and implementation.

        *Expected answer should cover: Privacy expectations (some cultures more sensitive about personal data), decision-making styles (individual vs collective), communication preferences (direct vs indirect), gender and diversity norms, authority structures, and how these affect interface design, data collection, and decision explanation.*

    13. **Short Answer (5 marks)**: Describe how chronic stress in a workplace environment could systematically bias an ML system designed to optimize employee productivity. What mitigation strategies would you recommend?

        *Expected answer should cover: Chronic stress creates abnormal baseline behavior patterns, leading to models optimized for stressed rather than healthy productivity. This could perpetuate harmful work environments. Mitigation includes monitoring employee wellbeing indicators, diverse data collection across different stress periods, and incorporating wellbeing metrics into optimization goals.*

    14. **Short Answer (10 marks)**: A healthcare AI system for mental health diagnosis shows different accuracy rates across different cultural groups. Analyze the potential causes related to human behavior patterns and cultural factors. How would you approach investigating and addressing these disparities?

        *Expected answer should cover: Potential causes include cultural differences in symptom expression, communication styles, stigma around mental health, training data bias from certain populations. Investigation approach should include demographic analysis of training data, cultural consultation, bias testing across groups. Solutions include diverse training data, culturally adapted interfaces, collaboration with cultural experts, ongoing monitoring for bias.*

    15. **Short Answer (5 marks)**: Explain the concept of "algorithmic aversion" and describe how understanding human psychology can help ML developers design systems that users are more likely to trust and adopt.

        *Expected answer should cover: Algorithmic aversion is the tendency to avoid or distrust algorithmic advice after seeing it make mistakes, even when it outperforms humans overall. Design solutions include showing confidence levels, allowing human override, explaining reasoning, demonstrating improvement over time, and gradually introducing automation to build trust.*
