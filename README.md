[**GO TO THE TEXTBOOK**](https://eatham532.github.io/Software-Engineering-HSC-Textbook/)

This project is a comprehensive digital textbook for the NSW HSC Software Engineering 11‚Äì12 Syllabus (2022+), presented as a static website using MkDocs with the Material theme.

The project is 90% generated by AI, with human editing for accuracy and clarity. It includes interactive diagrams, code samples, real-world case studies, and interactive quizzes to enhance learning. Because this is open source, it is a work in progress and will continue to evolve with community contributions.
