# NSW HSC Software Engineering Textbook

This project is a comprehensive digital textbook for the NSW HSC Software Engineering 11‚Äì12 Syllabus (2022+), presented as a static website using MkDocs with the Material theme.

The project is 90% generated by AI, with human editing for accuracy and clarity. It includes interactive diagrams, code samples, real-world case studies, and interactive quizzes to enhance learning. Because this is open source, it is a work in progress and will continue to evolve with community contributions.

## üìö Content Overview

### Year 11 Modules

- **Programming Fundamentals**: Software development, algorithms, data structures, and Python programming
- **Object-Oriented Paradigm**: OOP concepts, design patterns, and implementation in Python  
- **Programming Mechatronics**: Hardware-software integration and embedded systems

### Year 12 Modules

- **Programming for the Web**: Full-stack web development, databases, and Progressive Web Apps
- **Secure Software Architecture**: Security principles, cryptography, and secure coding practices
- **Software Automation**: Machine Learning, AI, automation impact assessment, and ethics

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

- All content is written in Markdown and organized by year, module, chapter, and section
- Interactive elements include quizzes, code examples, and PlantUML/Mermaid diagrams
- Assets (CSS, JavaScript, images) are stored in the `docs/assets/` folder
- Navigation is controlled via `.nav.yml` using the awesome-nav plugin

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Quizzes**: Each section includes quiz files with immediate feedback
- **Code Examples**: Extensive Python code samples with syntax highlighting
- **Diagrams**: PlantUML and Mermaid diagrams for visual learning
- **Responsive Design**: Material theme with dark/light mode support
- **Search**: Full-text search across all content
- **Accessibility**: WCAG-compliant design with keyboard navigation

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+ (this repo targets 3.13 but any 3.x should work)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for fast Python package management

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd NSW-HSC-Software-Engineering-Textbook
   ```

2. **Install dependencies using uv**:
   ```powershell
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   ```powershell
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Serve the site locally**:
   ```powershell
   mkdocs serve
   ```

5. **Open your browser** to the provided local URL (typically `http://127.0.0.1:8000`)

## ‚úèÔ∏è How to Contribute

### Content Editing

- Edit or add Markdown files in the `docs/Year11` and `docs/Year12` folders
- Follow the existing structure: Year ‚Üí Module ‚Üí Chapter ‚Üí Section
- Each section should have both `index.md` (content) and `quiz.md` (assessment)

### Navigation Management

- Control site navigation via `docs/.nav.yml` (using awesome-nav plugin)
- **Important**: Avoid adding a manual `nav:` section to `mkdocs.yml`
- The navigation file automatically generates the site structure

### Content Guidelines

- Use the exact terminology from module plans for syllabus alignment
- Include practical Python examples where appropriate
- Add interactive quiz questions for each section
- Follow accessibility guidelines (headings, alt text, etc.)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies

- **MkDocs**: Static site generator
- **Material Theme**: Modern, responsive design
- **Kroki Plugin**: PlantUML and Mermaid diagram rendering
- **Awesome Nav**: Dynamic navigation generation
- **Python**: Code examples and tooling

### Plugin Ecosystem

- `mkdocs-kroki-plugin`: Diagram rendering with PlantUML/Mermaid
- `mkdocs-include-markdown-plugin`: Content inclusion and reuse
- `mkdocs-macros-plugin`: Template variables and macros
- `mkdocs-awesome-nav`: Flexible navigation from `.nav.yml`

### Custom Assets

- **Interactive Quizzes**: Custom CSS/JS for quiz functionality
- **Diagram Modals**: Click-to-expand diagram viewing
- **Code Blocks**: Enhanced syntax highlighting and copy functionality
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first, accessibility-focused styling

## üß∞ Development Tools

### Automation Scripts

- **`scripts/serve.ps1`**: Quick local development server
- **`scripts/smoke_test.py`**: Post-build sanity checks and validation
- **`scripts/simple_md_lint.py`**: Basic Markdown linting and formatting
- **`scripts/fix_quiz_format.py`**: Automated quiz format standardization

### Code Quality

- Markdown linting for consistent formatting
- Automated quiz format validation
- Link checking and content validation
- Cross-platform compatibility testing

## üìä Project Status
