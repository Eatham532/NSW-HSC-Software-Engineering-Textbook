# NSW HSC Software Engineering Textbook

This project is a digital textbook for the NSW HSC Software Engineering 11–12 Syllabus (2022+), presented as a static website using MkDocs with the Material theme.

The project is 90% generated by AI, with human editing for accuracy and clarity. It includes interactive diagrams, code samples, and real-world case studies to enhance learning. Because this is open source, it is a work in progress and will continue to evolve with community contributions.

## Structure

- All content is written in Markdown and organized by year and topic.

- Images and assets are stored in the `assets/` folder.

## How to Edit

- Edit or add Markdown files in the `docs/Year11` and `docs/Year12` folders.

- Control navigation via `.nav.yml` (awesome-nav). Avoid adding a `nav:` section to `mkdocs.yml`.

## How to Build and View Locally

1. Ensure Python 3.13+ is installed (this repo targets 3.13; see `.python-version`).

2. Create/activate a virtual environment and install dependencies from `pyproject.toml`:

    ```powershell
    . .\.venv\Scripts\activate ; pip install -e .
    ```

3. Serve the site locally:

    ```powershell
    mkdocs serve
    ```

4. Open the provided local URL in your browser.

## Deployment

- The site can be deployed to GitHub Pages or any static hosting provider.

## Helpful scripts

- `scripts/serve.ps1` – local dev server

- `scripts/smoke_test.py` – sanity checks after build

- `scripts/simple_md_lint.py` – basic Markdown lint
