# NSW HSC Software Engineering Textbook

This project is a digital textbook for the NSW HSC Software Engineering 11â€“12 Syllabus (2022+), presented as a static website using MkDocs with the Material theme.

The project is 90% generated by AI, with human editing for accuracy and clarity. It includes interactive diagrams, code samples, and real-world case studies to enhance learning. Because this is open source, it is a work in progress and will continue to evolve with community contributions.

## Structure

- All content is written in Markdown and organized by year and topic.
- Images and assets are stored in the `assets/` folder.

## How to Edit

- Edit or add Markdown files in the `Year11` and `Year12` folders.
- Update `mkdocs.yml` to add new chapters to the navigation.

## How to Build and View Locally

1. Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed.
2. Install dependencies (already set up in the virtual environment):
    ```sh
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install mkdocs-material
    ```
3. Serve the site locally:
    ```sh
    mkdocs serve
    ```
4. Open the provided local URL in your browser.

## Deployment

- The site can be deployed to GitHub Pages or any static hosting provider.
